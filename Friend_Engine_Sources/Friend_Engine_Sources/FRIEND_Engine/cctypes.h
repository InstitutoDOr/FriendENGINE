/*
   NOTE: MSVC 5 did not have UINT32 defined. Version 6 however defines it
   in 'BASETSD.H', but wrong!!!!!:

//
// The following types are guaranteed to be signed and 32 bits wide.
//

typedef int LONG32, *PLONG32;
typedef int INT32, *PINT32;

//
// The following types are guaranteed to be unsigned and 32 bits wide.
//

typedef unsigned int ULONG32, *PULONG32;
typedef unsigned int DWORD32, *PDWORD32;
typedef unsigned int UINT32, *PUINT32;


    The int type will in future be 64 bits or more
