<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

MRIcron can run on Windows, Macintosh OSX and Linux computers. Because Macintosh and Linux builds require a beta-release compiler, installation on these operating systems may be somewhat
tricky. This software is covered under a variation of the BSD license. In theory, 
this software should work well on any of these platforms with recent hardware. 
However, currently Windows offers the optimal platform for four reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Graphics are more fluid in the Windows version: uses direct Windows API routines.</li>
  <li>Rendering is faster with the Windows version if you are using a multi-CPU system: Windows version multi-threads rendering, so rendering is twice as fast on a dual-core system.</li>
  <li>Windows version recognizes tablets, making it easier to draw volumes of interest (as it can detect stylus pressure, and can detect whether you are using the stylus tip or eraser).</li>
  <li>Windows version is the most popular, so it has received the most testing from users.</li>
</ul>
Hopefully, MRIcron should offer reasonable performance on any modern machine. There are a few ways to increase the performance of MRIcron, though <b>these techniques necessarily reduce the quality of the images</b>.
<ul>
  <li>In the main MRIcron window, make sure that the option '2D smooth all' in the 'View' menu is unchecked. This displays images with the rapid nearest-neighbor interpolation instead of the much slower bilinear interpolation.</li>
  <li>In the rendering window, make sure that the option 'Precise interpolation' in the 'View' menu is unchecked. This generates 3D renderings using nearest-neighbor interpolation instead of the slower trilinear interpolation. Renderings are typically three times faster.</li>
  <li>In the rendering window, you may want to turn off the 'Smooth background' option in the 'View' menu. This displays the raw rendering, instead of applying a 2D blur to the image. Note that this change has much less influence on rendering times than the 'precise interpolation' option (as the precise interpolation is done in all 3 dimensions, while the smooth is only computed in 2 dimensions). </li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows</span></p>

<ol>

  <li>Download the <a href="mricrond.zip">installer</a>.</li>

  <li>Unzip and run the installer (double click on the .zip file and run the program InstallMR.exe).</li>

  <li>By default, the installer places the programs in C:\program
files\mricron, simply double click on mricron.exe to run the software.</li>

  <li>You may also double-click on the .bat files, which load example
images, for example 'examplefmri.bat' shows two statistical maps on top
of a high resolution anatomical scan.</li>


  <li>Note: The file dcm2nii.exe is compressed using <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">UPX</a>, which can lead some virus software to <a href="http://forum.antivir-pe.de/thread.php?threadid=15453&sid=3abd073e228f9ba1c61f51e5960abfc6">generate false alarms (AntiVir PE Premium)</a>. This software is generated on a computer that always has the latest update's for Trend Micro's OfficeScan virus detection software.</li>

</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux x86  32bit </span>If
anyone finds an easier way to distribute this software for Linux,
please contact me. I am still finding it tricky to develop a universal
protocol for dealing with the dependencies of different distributions.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> 
<br>&nbsp;<b>Note</b>The Linux-native version of MRIcron was created using a beta release compiler. In many cases the best solution is to run the Windows-native version of MRIcron using <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> or a virtualized Windows environment (e.g. <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMware player</a>, QEMU or Xen).<p>

<ol>

  <li>Download the <a href="mricronlx.zip">software</a>.</li>

  <li>Unzip the software (for modern Linux systems, right click on the file mricronlx.zip and choose to 'extract here').</li>

  <li>Open a terminal window.</li>

  <li>Change to the folder where you installed mricron, e.g. cd ~/mricron</li>

  <li>Launch mricron by typing ./mricron (note you must be in the same folder as the mricron executable.</li>

  <li>You can also run the example .bat files, for example ./xfmri.bat
shows two statistical maps on top of a high resolution anatomical scan.</li>

  
  <ol>

    <li>In case you receive error messages, check if all the dependencies of the program are installed. In particular, you need</li>

    
    <ol>

      <li>GTK 1.2 (this is called GTK+ by some distributions, and gtk by others)</li>

      <li>libgdk_lixbuf2.0</li>

    
    </ol>

    <li>You can see a complete list of .so files needed by the software using the command:<br>

&nbsp; ldd ./mricron</li>

    <li>In case you cannot run the program and it displays a message
saying it cannot find one of these libraries (you must run the program
from the command line to see error messages), you need to download and
install a package for the necessary library:
      
      <ul>

        
        <ul>

          <li>On RPM-based distributions you can find packages here: http://rpm.pbone.net/</li>

          <li>On Debian-based distributions you can find packages here: http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages<br>

          </li>

        
        </ul>

  <li>Unzip the software (double click on the .zip file - a new folder called mricron will be created).</li>

  <li>You will need to install X11.&nbsp;</li>

  
  <ol>

    <li>Check to see if X11 is in the applications\utilities folder.</li>

    <li>If X11 is not installed:</li>

    
    <ol>

      <li>OSX 10.4 user can install X11 by using the DVD installer disk</li>

<br>

<b>Linux x86 64bit</b> While the x86-32bit version may run, in theory it should be possible to create a 64-bit native version by recompiling the <a href="http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron/source.html">source code</a>.
<br>&nbsp;<b>Note</b>The Linux-native version of MRIcron was created using a beta release compiler. In many cases the best solution is to run the Windows-native version of MRIcron using <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> or a virtualized Windows environment (e.g. <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMware player</a>, QEMU or Xen).<p>

<ol>



  <li>Install the compiler.&nbsp;To compile this software, you will need a build of Lazarus created on
or after May 1, 2006. This software requires some recent patches that
are not available on the current stable release. To get the latest
developmental snapshot of Lazarus, click <a href="http://www.hu.freepascal.org/lazarus/">here</a>. </li>



  <li>Get the source code. The source code is available <a href="mricron.zip">here</a>. The source
file includes sample images in the Templates and Example folders. To
test this software, compile mricron.lpr. Next use the File/templates
menu to open sample images. Alternatively, after compiling the
software, you can click on the included .bat files to see sample
renderings.</li>


  <li>Linux users:You need to have write access to the folder where you
run MRIcron (it will want to create .ini files) I suggest placing this
software in your home directory.</li>
