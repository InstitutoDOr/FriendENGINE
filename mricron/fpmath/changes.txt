Version 0.50
------------

* Added a compilation script for Linux (fpcompil.sh)

* A graphic library (tpgraph) has been added, with two versions: one for Delphi, one for the Graph unit. The Linux version requires SVGAlib installed and functional.

* With FPC, the libraries are now compiled in Delphi mode (option -Mdelphi) to ensure that the Integer type is 32 bits. The calling programs should be compiled with the same option (modify the FPC configuration file if necessary).

* The number of points which can be handled by the FFT procedures has been increased (up to 2^26 in double precision)

* More statistical methods in the main library :

  - Comparison of means and variances
  - Analysis of variance
  - Non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis)
  - Histograms
  - Comparison of distributions (Khi-2 and Woolf tests)
  - Linear, multilinear and nonlinear regressions
  - Monte-Carlo simulation of the distribution of regression parameters
  - Principal component analysis

* Added some string functions
