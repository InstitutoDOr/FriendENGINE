This is a beta release of MRIcron. You can compile this using Lazarus. It has been compiled on Windows, Linux-x86, OSX-x86 and OSX-PPC. It requires builds of Lazarus and FreePascal created after October 7, 2007.

-------------------------------------------
To compile for OSX [Carbon] - 
1.) Launch Lazarus and open the project.
2.) Select Project/CompilerOptions
   Paths tab: make sure the "LCL widget type" is set to "carbon"
   Linking tab: make sure the "Pass options to linker" checkbox is selected and
      set the text to "-framework carbon" (no quotes).
3.) Select Project/ProjectOptions and set "Use application bundle for running and debugging"
4.) If using OSX 10.5 or later, add to Project / Compiler options / Other / Custom options:    
     -k-macosx_version_min -k10.4
     -XR/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/
     Alternative: Project/ProjectOptions/Linking/ Check 'pass options to linker' and add this line -macosx_version_min 10.4
5.) For debugging, you will want to create an alias from the application folder to the compiled executable:
   The exact value will depend on your paths, but it will be similar to this: 
      rm ~/Documents/mricron/mricron.app/mricron
      ln -s ~/Documents/mricron/mricron ~/Documents/mricron/mricron.app/mricron
      rm ~/Documents/mricron/npm/npm.app/npm
      ln -s ~/Documents/mricron/npm/npm ~/Documents/mricron/npm/npm.app/npm
      rm ~/Documents/mricron/dcm2nii/dcm2niigui.app/dcm2niigui
      ln -s ~/Documents/mricron/dcm2nii/dcm2niigui ~/Documents/mricron/dcm2nii/dcm2niigui.app/dcm2niigui
    
6.) Select Run/Run to build and execute your program
7.) For making an executable to distribute, control+click on the program's .app folder (e.g. the file named mricron that has a brain icon) and choose "show package contents" - move the executable generated with Lazarus into the folder, overwriting the symbolic link created in step 4.
