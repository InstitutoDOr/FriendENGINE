# The following section determines what to do when fsl_sub is called
# by an FSL program. If it finds a local cluster if will pass the
# commands onto the cluster. Otherwise it will run the commands
# itself. There are two values for the METHOD variable, "SGE" and
# "NONE". You should setup the tests to look for whether the calling
# computer can see your cluster setup scripts, and run them (if that's
# what you want, i.e. if you haven't already run them in the user's
# login scripts). Note that these tests look for the environment
# variable SGE_ROOT, which a user can unset if they don't want the
# cluster to be used.

# take (in the case of the -t option, how long each line in the
# supplied file is expected to take). You need to setup the following
# list to map ranges of timings into your cluster queues - it doesn't
# matter how many you setup, that's up to you.

$command V1.0beta - wrapper for job control system such as SGE

Usage: $command [options] <command>

$command gzip *.img *.hdr
$command -q short.q gzip *.img *.hdr
$command -a darwin regscript rawdata outputdir ...

  -T <minutes>          Estimated job length in minutes, used to auto-set queue name
  -q <queuename>        Possible values for <queuename> are "verylong.q", "long.q" 
                        and "short.q". See below for details
                        Default is "long.q".
  -a <arch-name>        Architecture [e.g., darwin or lx24-amd64]
  -p <job-priority>     Lower priority [0:-1024] default = 0                 
  -M <email-address>    Who to email, default = `whoami`@fmrib.ox.ac.uk 
  -j <jid>              Place a hold on this task until job jid has completed
  -t <filename>         Specify a task file of commands to execute in parallel
  -N <jobname>          Specify jobname as it will appear on queue
  -l <logdirname>       Where to output logfiles
  -m <mailoptions>      Change the SGE mail options, see qsub for details
  -F                    Use flags embedded in scripts to set SGE queuing options
  -v                    Verbose mode.

Queues:

There are several batch queues configured on the cluster, each with defined CPU
time limits. All queues, except bigmem.q, have a 8GB memory limit.

veryshort.q:This queue is for jobs which last under 30mins.
short.q:    This queue is for jobs which last up to 4h. 
long.q:     This queue is for jobs which last less than 24h. Jobs run with a
            nice value of 10.
verylong.q: This queue is for jobs which will take longer than 24h CPU time.
            There is one slot per node, and jobs on this queue have a nice value
            of 15.
bigmem.q:   This queue is like the verylong.q but has no memory limits.

# flags so that they prepare the right arguments for the actual
# cluster queue submission program, in our case "qsub".
#
# -a sets is the cluster submission flag for controlling the required
# hardware architecture (normally not set by the calling program)
#
# -p set the priority of the job - ignore this if your cluster
# environment doesn't have priority control in this way.
#
# -j tells the cluster not to start this job until cluster job ID $jid
# has completed. You will need this feature.
#
# -t will pass on to the cluster software the name of a text file
# containing a set of commands to run in parallel; one command per
# line.
#
# -N option determines what the command will be called when you list
# running processes.
#
# -l tells the cluster what to call the standard output and standard
# -error logfiles for the submitted program.
