<P>BET (Brain Extraction Tool) deletes non-brain tissue from an image
of the whole head. It can also estimate the inner and outer skull
surfaces, and outer scalp surface, if you have good quality
T1 <i>and</i> T2 input images.

<P>Changes: The old C program called <b>bet</b> has now been
discontinued; the <b>bet2</b> C++ program gives almost identical
results. <b>betall</b> has been replaced by the -A and -A2 options in
the new <b>bet</b> script. <b>betfunc</b> has been replaced by the -F
option in <b>bet</b>. <b>betpremask</b> has been replaced by the -b
option in <b>standard_space_roi</b>. <b>betsmallz</b> has been
replaced by the -Z option in <b>bet</b>.

<A NAME="bet"></A><hr><H2>bet and bet2</H2>

<p>By default <b>bet</b> just calls the <b>bet2</b> program for simple
  brain extraction. However, it also allows various additional
  behaviour. The basic usage is:

<p><b>bet &lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt; [options]</b>


<p><b>Main bet2 options:</b>

<p><b>-o</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generate brain surface outline overlaid onto original image

<p><b>-m</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generate binary brain mask

<p><b>-s</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generate rough skull image (not as
  clean as what <b>betsurf</b> generates)

<p><b>-n</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't generate the default brain image output

<p><b>-f &lt;f&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fractional intensity threshold (0->1); default=0.5; smaller values give larger brain outline estimates

<p><b>-g &lt;g&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vertical gradient in fractional intensity threshold (-1->1); default=0; positive values give larger brain outline at bottom, smaller at top

<p><b>-r &lt;r&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head radius (mm not voxels); initial surface sphere is set to half of this

<p><b>-c &lt x y z&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centre-of-gravity (voxels not mm) of initial mesh surface.

<p><b>-t</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apply thresholding to segmented brain image and mask

<p><b>-e</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generates brain surface as mesh in .vtk format. 



<p><b>Variations on default bet2 functionality (mutually exclusive options):</b>

<p><b>-R</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option runs more "robust" brain
  centre estimation; it repeatedly calls <b>bet2</b>, each time using
  the same input image and the same main options, except that
  the <b>-c</b> option (which sets the starting centre of the brain
  estimation) is set each time to the centre-of-gravity of the
  previously estimated brain extraction. The primary purpose is to
  improve the brain extraction when the input data contains a lot of
  non-brain matter - most likely when there is a lot of neck included
  in the input image. By iterating in this way the centre-of-gravity
  should move up each time towards the true centre, resulting in a
  better final estimate. The iterations stop when the
  centre-of-gravity stops moving, up to a maximum of 10 iterations.

<p><b>-S</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This attempts to cleanup residual eye
  and optic nerve voxels which <b>bet2</b> can sometimes leave
  behind. This can be useful when running SIENA or SIENAX, for
  example. Various stages involving standard-space masking,
  morphpological operations and thresholdings are combined to produce
  a result which can often give better results than just
  running <b>bet2</b>.

<p><b>-B</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This attempts to reduce image bias, and
  residual neck voxels. This can be useful when running SIENA or
  SIENAX, for example. Various stages involving FAST
  segmentation-based bias field removal and standard-space masking are
  combined to produce a result which can often give better results
  than just running <b>bet2</b>.

<p><b>-Z</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can improve the brain extraction
  if only a few slices are present in the data (i.e., a small field of
  view in the Z direction). This is achieved by padding the end slices
  in both directions, copying the end slices several times,
  running <b>bet2</b> and then removing the added slices.

<p><b>-F</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option uses <b>bet2</b> to
determine a brain mask on the basis of the first volume in a 4D data
set, and applies this to the whole data set. This is principally
intended for use on FMRI data, for example to remove eyeballs. Because
it is normally important (in this application) that masking be liberal
(ie that there be little risk of cutting out valid brain voxels) the
-f threshold is reduced to 0.3, and also the brain mask is "dilated"
slightly before being used.

<p><b>-A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This runs both <b>bet2</b>
  and <b>betsurf</b> programs in order to get the additional skull and
  scalp surfaces created by <b>betsurf</b>. This involves registering
  to standard space in order to allow <b>betsurf</b> to find the
  standard space masks it needs.

<p><b>-A2 &lt;T2&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the same
  as <b>-A</b> except that a T2 image is also input, to further
  improve the estimated skull and scalp surfaces. As well as carrying
  out the standard space registration this also registers the T2 to
  the T1 input image.

<p>The old script <b>betpremask</b> has been replaced with
  the <b>-b</b> option in <b>standard_space_roi</b>. This
  uses <b>flirt</b> to register the input image to a standard space
  whole-head image; the resulting transform is then inverted and a
  standard-space brain mask is transformed into the space of the input
  image, and then applied to this to create the output.


<A NAME="betgui"></A><hr><H2>Bet GUI</H2>

<H3>MAIN OPTIONS</H3>

<P>First set the <b>Input image</b> filename and the <b>Output
    image</b> filename. The output name is also used to generate the
    filenames for any optional outputs that are turned
    on in <b>Advanced options</b>.
 
<P>Changing <B>Fractional intensity threshold</B> from its default
value of 0.5 will cause the overall segmented brain to become larger
(<0.5) or smaller (>0.5). This threshold must lie between 0 and 1.

<p>If you change the options menu from the default setting of <b>Run
    standard brain extraction using bet2</b> then you will get one of
    the <b>Variations on default bet2 functionality</b> described
    above.

<H3>ADVANCED OPTIONS</H3>
 
<P>By default the only output from BET is an image with all non-brain
matter removed - this is the <B>Output brain-extracted image</B>
option.

<P>The <B>Output binary brain mask image</B> option tells BET to
output a binary brain mask (0 outside of the brain and 1 inside). This
can then be used in later processing, to mask other images derived
from the original.

<P>The <B>Apply thresholding to brain and mask image</B> option causes
BET to apply thresholding to the segmented brain image (and also the
brain mask if selected). Thus, inside the estimated brain, some voxels
can be "zeroed" after segmentation, if their intensity falls below an
automatically estimated threshold.

<P>The <B>Output exterior skull surface image</B> option tells BET
to produce an image which is an estimate of the exterior surface of
the skull. All non-skull-surface points are 0 in this image, and
skull-surface points are 100.

<p>The 
<B>Output brain surface overlaid onto original image</B> option
creates an output image which is a copy of the original image, with
additionally an outline of the brain's surface drawn on top.

<P>Changing <B>Threshold gradient</B> from its default value of 0
causes a gradient to be apply to the previous threshold. Thus setting
a positive value here causes the primary threshold to be reduced at
the bottom of the brain, giving a larger brain estimate there, and a
smaller estimate of the brain towards the top of the image. This value
must lie between -1 and 1.

  




<A NAME="betsurf"></A><hr><H2>betsurf</H2>

<p><b>betsurf</b> is the program that produces the three additional
surfaces (inner & outer skull, outer scalp). It can output these
surfaces as filled-in binary mask images, surface-only binary mask
images and <a href="http://www.geomview.org">Geomview</a> OFF mesh
format files.

<p>betsurf requires ideally good resolution T1- and T2-weighted input
images. It can work only from just a T1 image, but the results will
generally not be as good. The images should ideally be better than
2x2x2mm - the smaller the voxel size the better. betsurf requires that
bet2 has already been run on the T1 image, with the -e mesh output
option for the brain surface. It also requires that the T2 image
already be aligned (e.g., using <a
href="../flirt/index.html">flirt</a>) to the T1. Finally, it requires
that you supply a transformation from the T1 to standard space (e.g.,
generated by flirt) as it uses standard-space masks in order to
constraint some of the mesh fitting.

<p> The .vtk and .off Geomview mesh files contain mm co-ordinates. If
the image has radiological ordering ( see fslorient ) then the mm
co-ordinates are the voxel co-ordinates scaled by the mm voxel
sizes. If the image has neurological ordering the y and z co-ordinates
are the same as for radiological ordering, but the x co-ordinates will
be inverted ( x_mm = ( n - 1 - x ) * x_dim ) where n is the number of
voxels in the x-direction, x is the voxel co-ordinate and x_dim is the
voxel size in mm.

<p>As an example of how to use bet2 and betsurf together, see the -A
and -A2 options in the <b>bet</b> script. The -A2 option:<UL>

<LI>Registers the T2 to the T1 image.

<LI>Registers the T1 image to standard space (not to transform the
image but just to get the transform matrix itself).

<LI>Runs bet2 to get the initial brain extraction from the T1 image.

<LI>Runs betsurf to get the other head surfaces.
