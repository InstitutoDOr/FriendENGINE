<p><i><b>New version:</b> TBSS v1.2 has switched the nonlinear
  registration to using <a href=../fnirt/index.html>FNIRT</a> (FMRIB's
  Nonlinear Registration Tool). FNIRT is about 15 times faster than
  IRTK on FA data and possibly a little more 'accurate'. A TBSS v1.2
  analysis is <b>not</b> compatible with an older analysis. To see the
  full list of changes from the previous version
  see <a href="#new">what's new</a></i>.

<a name="intro"></a><p><hr><H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance
diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity
in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white
matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from
diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how
strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging
studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical
analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development,
degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by
the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not been a
satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from
multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be
drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis.  Furthermore, the
arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not been
resolved. TBSS aims to solve these issues via a) carefully tuned
nonlinear registration, followed by b) projection onto an
alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA
skeleton"). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and
interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging
studies.

<hr><b>Referencing TBSS</b>

<p><i>Brief summary text:</i> Voxelwise statistical analysis of the FA
data was carried out using TBSS (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics,
[Smith 2006]), part of FSL [Smith 2004]. TBSS projects all subjects'
FA data onto a mean FA tract skeleton, before applying voxelwise
cross-subject statistics.

<p><i>More detailed summary text:</i> Voxelwise statistical analysis
of the FA data was carried out using TBSS (Tract-Based Spatial
Statistics, [Smith 2006]), part of FSL [Smith 2004]. First, FA images
were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data using
FDT, and then brain-extracted using BET [Smith 2002]. All subjects' FA
data were then aligned into a common space using the nonlinear
registration tool FNIRT [Andersson 2007a, 2007b], which uses a
b-spline representation of the registration warp field [Rueckert
1999]. Next, the mean FA image was created and thinned to create a
mean FA skeleton which represents the centres of all tracts common to
the group. Each subject's aligned FA data was then projected onto this
skeleton and the resulting data fed into voxelwise cross-subject
statistics.

<a name="overview"></a><p><hr><H2>Running TBSS - Overview</H2>

<p>Running TBSS first involves running a few simple steps/scripts:

<UL>

<LI><b>preprocessing</b> - create FA images from your diffusion study data

<LI><b>tbss_1_preproc</b> - prepare your FA data in your TBSS working
  directory in the right format

<LI><b>tbss_2_reg</b> - apply nonlinear registration of all FA images into standard space

<LI><b>tbss_3_postreg</b> - create the mean FA image and skeletonise it

<LI><b>tbss_4_prestats</b> - project all subjects' FA data onto the mean FA skeleton

<LI><b>stats (e.g., randomise)</b> - feed the 4D projected FA data
  into GLM modelling and thresholding in order to find voxels which
  correlate with your model.

</UL>

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ details -->

We now go through the TBSS steps in detail.

<!-- {{{ 0 - create FA data from a diffusion MRI study -->

<a name="0"></a><hr><h3>0 - create FA data from a diffusion MRI study</h3>

In order to run TBSS you need to create a single FA image from each
subject in the study. We recommend that you do this using tools in the
<a href="../fdt/index.html">FDT</a> FSL toolbox; in brief:
<br>1. Correct your original data for the effects of head movement and
eddy currents using <code>eddy_correct</code>
<br>2. Create a brain mask by running <code>bet</code> on one of the
B=0 (no diffusion weighting) images
<br>3. Fit the diffusion tensor model using <code>dtifit</code>

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 1 - tbss_1_preproc -->

<a name="1"></a><hr><h3>1 - tbss_1_preproc</h3>

You now need to create a new, empty directory (folder) in which you will run
the TBSS analysis, for example:

<pre>mkdir mytbss</pre>

Then copy into there all of your subjects' FA images, giving each
subject's FA image a different name. You will make later analysis
easier if you name the images in a logical order, for example so that
all controls are listed before all patients:

<pre>cd mytbss
ls
  CON_N00300_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  CON_N00302_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  CON_N00499_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  PAT_N00373_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  PAT_N00422_dti_data_FA.nii.gz
  PAT_N03600_dti_data_FA.nii.gz</pre>

You are now nearly ready to run the first TBSS script, which will
erode your FA images slightly and zero the end slices (to remove
likely outliers from the diffusion tensor fitting). Type:

<pre><b>tbss_1_preproc *.nii.gz</b></pre>

(the <code>*</code> expands to the list of input images).

<p>The script will also move all the images into a new sub-directory
called <code>FA</code> (where all the registration steps will later
take place,) and will also create another sub-directory
called <code>origdata</code> and place all your original images in
there for posterity.

<p>Finally, the script runs <code>slicesdir</code>, which creates an
overview webpage containing a static view of each of the input images,
so that you can then quickly view each of them for obvious problems.

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 2 - tbss_2_reg -->

<a name="2"></a><hr><h3>2 - tbss_2_reg</h3>

The next TBSS script runs the nonlinear registration, aligning all FA
images to a 1x1x1mm standard space. The target image used in the
registrations can either be a pre-defined target, or can be
automatically chosen to be the most "typical" subject in the study.

<p>In general we recommend using the <a
href="../data/FMRIB58_FA.html">FMRIB58_FA</a> standard-space image as the
target in TBSS. This involves carrying out just one registration per
subject and generally gives good alignment results. This option is
applied by using the <code>-T</code> flag. Alternatively, you can
supply your own target image by using the <code>-t</code> option.

<p>The third option is to align every FA image to every other one,
identify the "most representative" one, and use this as the target
image. This target image is then affine-aligned into MNI152 standard
space, and every image is transformed into 1x1x1mm MNI152 space by
combining the nonlinear transform to the target FA image with the
affine transform from that target to MNI152 space. This option is
selected by using the <code>-n</code> flag, and is the recommended
option if you need to generate a study-specific, for example if the
subjects are all young children (and hence the adult-derived
FMRIB58_FA target is inappropriate).

<p>Direct registration to the high resolution FMRIB58_FA image takes
about 15 minutes x N subjects (when running on a single computer). In
comparison, the all-subjects-to-all-subjects option takes about 5
minutes x N x N. Hence the latter approach can take much longer to run
than the former.

<p>If your lab has a batch submission system (e.g., SGE) then you may
  want to setup FSL to take advantage of this - then all the
  registration jobs get submitted to the batch system for parallel
  processing. In this case, ask your system administrator to edit
  $FSLDIR/bin/fsl_sub in order to setup FSL to make use of your
  cluster environment. Once this is done, running tbss_2_reg submits
  all the registrations to your batch system, and you need to watch
  for them all to complete before moving on to the next stage of TBSS.

<p>Once <b>all</b> the registrations have finished running, you are
  ready to move onto the next step.

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 3 - tbss_3_postreg -->

<a name="3"></a><hr><h3>3 - tbss_3_postreg</h3>

<p>The next TBSS script applies the nonlinear transforms found in the
previous stage to all subjects to bring them into standard space.

<p>If the previous stage was run with the <code>-n</code> option (find
the most typical subject as the target), then this script first needs
to make the decision about which of your FA images is the most
"typical", for selection as the target image to apply all nonlinear
transformations into the space of. (The script does this by taking
each FA image in turn, and estimating the average amount of warping
that was necessary to align all other images to it; it then finds the
one that had the smallest amount of average warping when used as a
target.) Obviously if you pre-specified the FA target image then this
step is automatically skipped. The script then takes the target and
affine-aligns it into 1x1x1mm MNI152 space - this resolution is chosen
as the later skeletonisation and projection steps work well at this
resolution, and the choice of working in MNI152 space is chosen for
convenience of display and coordinate reporting later. Once this is
done, each subject's FA image has the nonlinear transform to the
target and then the affine transform to MNI152 space applied,
resulting in a transformation of the original FA image into MNI152
space (actually the two transformations are combined before being
applied, to avoid having to resample the image twice).

<p>The above results in a standard-space version of each subject's FA
  image; next these are all merged into a single 4D image file called
  <code>all_FA</code>, created in a new subdirectory called
  <code>stats</code>. Next, the mean of all FA images is created,
  called <code>mean_FA</code>, and this is then fed into the FA
  skeletonisation program to create <code>mean_FA_skeleton</code>.

<p>All of the above is done simply by running the script:

<pre><b>tbss_3_postreg -S</b></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you wish to use the FMRIB58_FA mean FA image and
its derived skeleton, instead of the mean of your subjects in the
study, use the <code>-T</code> option:

<pre><b>tbss_3_postreg -T</b></pre>

<p>In general we would recommend using the <code>-S</code> option
(derive the mean FA and skeleton from the actual subjects you have).

<p><img src="eg_skel_all_FA.png" align="right"> The script finishes by
telling you to check whether a suitable threshold for the mean FA
skeleton is 0.2 (a typical value used by the next script). For
example, load the 4D FA data and the skeleton into FSLView:

<pre>cd stats
fslview all_FA -b 0,0.8 mean_FA_skeleton -b 0.2,0.8 -l Green</pre>

<p>The <code>-b</code> option sets sensible display range options, and
  in the case of the skeleton image, also controls the thresholding
  applied. Now turn on the movie loop; you will see the mean FA
  skeleton on top of each different subject's aligned FA image. If all
  the processing so far has worked ok the skeleton should look like
  the examples shown here (see the TBSS paper for more examples of
  different subjects' results underneath the skeleton). If the
  registration has worked well you should see that in general each
  subject's major tracts are reasonably well aligned to the relevant
  parts of the skeleton. If you set the skeleton threshold (in
  FSLView, the lower of the display range settings) much lower than
  0.2, it will extend away towards extremes where there is too much
  cross-subject variability and where the nonlinear registration has
  not been able to attain good alignments. Remember the skeleton
  threshold for the next stage.

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 4 - tbss_4_prestats -->

<a name="4"></a><hr><h3>4 - tbss_4_prestats</h3>

<p>The last TBSS script carries out the final steps necessary before
  you run the voxelwise cross-subject stats. It thresholds the mean FA
  skeleton image at the chosen threshold - a common value that works
  well is 0.2 (see above). To run, type:

<pre><b>tbss_4_prestats 0.2</b></pre>

replacing the <code>0.2</code> with another value if you need to
change it.

<p>The resulting binary skeleton mask defines the set of voxels used
  in all subsequent processing. Next a "distance map" is created from
  the skeleton mask. This is used in the projection of FA onto the
  skeleton (see the TBSS paper for more detail). Finally, the script
  takes the 4D all_FA image (containing all subjects' aligned FA data)
  and, for each "timepoint" (i.e., subject ID), projects the FA data
  onto the mean FA skeleton. This results in a 4D image file
  containing the (projected) skeletonised FA data. It is this file
  that you will feed into voxelwise statistics in the next section.

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ 5 - voxelwise statistics on the skeletonised FA data -->

<a name="5"></a><hr><h3>5 - voxelwise statistics on the skeletonised FA data</h3>

<p>The previous step resulted in the 4D skeletonised FA
  image <code>all_FA_skeletonised</code> (in the <code>stats</code>
  subdirectory). It is this that you now feed into voxelwise
  statistics, that, for example, tells you which FA skeleton voxels
  are significantly different between two groups of subjects.

<p>One recommended way of doing the stats is to use
  the <code>randomise</code> tool. For more detail see
  the <a href="../randomise/index.html">randomise manual</a>. Before
  running <code>randomise</code> you will need to generate a design
  matrix file, e.g., <code>design.mat</code> and contrasts file,
  e.g., <code>design.con</code>. You can use the
  script <code>design_ttest2</code> in the simple case of a two-group
  comparison. Alternatively you can use the <b>Glm</b> GUI to generate
  these design matrix and contrast files. Note that the order of the
  entries (rows) in your design matrix <i>must</i> match the
  alphabetical order of your original FA images, as that determines
  the order of the aligned FA images in the final 4D
  file <code>all_FA_skeletonised</code>; check this with:

<pre>
cd FA
imglob *_FA.*
</pre>

<p>We recommend using
  the <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/tfce">TFCE</a>
  (Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement) option in randomise. This is
  somewhat similar to cluster-based thresholding, but generally more
  robust and avoids the need for the arbitrary initial cluster-forming
  threshold. To use this on TBSS-preprocessed data, add
  the <code>--T2</code> option to randomise.

<p>So, say you have 7 controls (with original filenames
  <code>CON_001_dti_FA.nii.gz</code> etc.) and 11 patients (with
  original filenames <code>PAT_001_dti_FA.nii.gz</code> etc.). You can
  generate design files and run voxelwise statistics and inference
  using randomisation, including cluster-based thresholding, using:

<pre>
cd ../stats
design_ttest2 design 7 11

randomise -i all_FA_skeletonised -o tbss -m mean_FA_skeleton_mask -d design.mat -t design.con -n 500 --T2 -V

fslview $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm mean_FA_skeleton -l Green -b 0.2,0.8 tbss_tstat1 -l Red-Yellow -b 3,6 tbss_tstat2 -l Blue-Lightblue -b 3,6
</pre>

<p>In this case, contrast 1 gives the control&gt;patient test and
  contrast 2 gives the control&lt;patient test. The raw
  (unthresholded) tstat images are <code>tbss_tstat1</code>
  and <code>tbss_tstat2</code> respectively. The TFCE p-value
  images (fully corrected for multiple comparisons across space)
  are <code>tbss_tfce_corrp_tstat1</code> and <code>tbss_tfce_corrp_tstat2</code>
  (note, these are actually 1-p for convenience of display, so
  thresholding at .95 gives significant clusters).

<!-- {{{ non-FA -->

<a name="nonFA"></a><p><hr><H2>Using non-FA Images in TBSS</H2>

<p>It is straightforward to apply TBSS to other diffusion-derived data
  than FA images. For example, you may be interested in how MD (mean
  diffusivity) or the first diffusion tensor eigenvalue varies between
  different subjects.

<p>To achieve this we recommend using the FA images to achieve the
  nonlinear registration and skeletonisation stages, and also to
  estimate the projection vectors from each individual subject onto
  the mean FA skeleton. The nonlinear warps and skeleton projection
  can then also be applied to other images such as the second
  eigenvalue. The following instructions assume that you want to run
  TBSS on the second eigenvalue, named L2 by dtifit:

<UL>

<LI>Run the full TBSS analysis (see all steps above) on your FA data.

<LI>Create a new directory called L2 (or any other name) in your TBSS
  analysis directory (the one that contains the
  existing <code>origdata</code>, <code>FA</code>
  and <code>stats</code> directories from the FA
  analysis):<br><code>mkdir L2</code>

<LI>Copy your L2 images into this new directory, making sure that they
  are named <b>exactly</b> the same as the original FA images were (look in
  <code>origdata</code> to check the original names).

<LI>Now, making sure that you are in your top working TBSS directory
  (the one that now contains FA, stats and L2 subdirectories) and run
  the <code>tbss_non_FA</code> script, telling it that the alternate
  data is called L2. This will apply the original nonlinear
  registration to the L2 data, merge all subjects' warped L2 data into
  a 4D file <code>stats/all_L2</code>, project this onto the original
  mean FA skeleton (using the original FA data to find the projection
  vectors), resulting in the 4D projected data
  <code>stats/all_L2_skeletonised</code>:<br><code>tbss_non_FA
  L2</code>

<LI>You can now run voxelwise stats on the projected 4D
  data <code>all_L2_skeletonised</code> <a href="#5">in the same
  manner as described above</a>.

</UL>

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ sym -->

<a name="sym"></a><p><hr><H2>Testing left vs. right in TBSS</H2>

<p>In order to test skeleton voxels on the left of the brain vs. those
  on the right (i.e., testing for asymmetries in diffusion
  characteristics), it is necessary to derive (and project onto) a
  slightly different mean FA skeleton - one that is
  symmetric. Obviously this skeleton needs to be restricted to only
  those parts of the "original" skeleton that are already sufficiently
  close to being symmetric - i.e. where there is reasonable
  correspondence in general tract structure between left and right in
  the brain.

<p>To run such analysis, first complete the above TBSS processing
  steps 1-4. Then cd into the stats subdirectory in your TBSS
  analysis. Use the script <code>tbss_sym</code>; if you want to apply
  the symmetry analysis to the FA data, type<br><code>tbss_sym
  FA</code><br> or if you want to apply it to other diffusion data
  (that has previously been processed using <code>tbss_non_FA</code>),
  such as <code>MO</code>, type<br><code>tbss_sym MO</code><br>

<p>The script first generates the symmetric mean-FA image and derived
  skeleton, mask and distance map, unless these have already been
  generated by a previous run of <code>tbss_sym</code>. The rest of
  this paragraph can be ignored if you are not interested in the
  details of how the symmetric skeleton is derived. First, the
  original (asymmetric) skeleton is dilated (thickened) by one voxel,
  and saved to a temporary file. Next, the symmetrised mean-FA image
  <code>mean_FA_symmetrised</code> is generated, just by flipping and
  average <code>mean_FA</code>. This is then skeletonised to generate
  the initial symmetric skeleton. This skeleton is masked by the
  dilated original skeleton - this step ensures that only skeleton
  structures that are already <i>close</i> to being symmetric in the
  original data are used in this left-right analysis. Finally, to be
  absolutely sure the final skeleton is exactly symmetric, it is
  flipped and masked with the non-flipped version, creating
  symmetrised skeleton <code>mean_FA_symmetrised_skeleton</code>. A
  thresholded skeleton mask image and derived distance map are then
  derived from this.

<p>Now, the 4D prealigned data <code>all_FA</code> (or non-FA
  equivalent, if requested) is projected onto the symmetrised
  skeleton, resulting in 4D file
  <code>all_FA_symmetrised_skeletonised</code> (etc.). This could now
  be left-right tested. However, To make this straightforward two
  final steps are carried out: 1) The 4D dataset is left-right
  flipped, and the latter subtracted from the former. 2) The left half
  of this dataset (corresponding to the "right" side of standard
  space) is then zeroed, as the same information (inverted) is present
  on the left and right sides of the image. This results in 4D image
  <code>all_FA_skeletonised_left_minus_right</code>.

<p>Therefore the simplest possible analysis
  with <code>randomise</code> is just to test whether the mean of this
  data is significantly greater than zero, using
  the <code>-1</code> option instead of entering a design matrix and
  contrast file. This tests for L&gt;R. To test for R&gt;L, either
  invert the data and re-run <code>randomise</code>, or create an
  appropriate design matrix and contrast file.

<a name="display"></a><p><hr><H2>Displaying TBSS Results</H2>

<p><img src="stats_eg.png" align="right">In this section we give some
  hints on how to present TBSS results. You might want to use either
  the MNI152 background image or your mean_FA study-specific image -
  or you may want to show TBSS results on top of both. If you use your
  mean_FA image as the background, make sure that you set a good
  display range, for example 0:0.6. For the rest of this section
  we'll assume that you want to show results on top of the MNI152
  image and hence start by loading MNI152 into FSLView.

<p>You will probably next want to load the mean_FA_skeleton image on
  top of your background image, to show where the skeleton was
  estimated, and which standard-space voxels were tested in the
  multi-subjects statistics. Load mean_FA_skeleton into FSLView and
  set its display range correctly. The lower threshold <b>must</b> be
  set to the threshold that you used in the TBSS analysis, for example
  0.2. The upper level should probably be set to something like 0.7,
  so that you can see variation in mean FA values within the
  skeleton. You probably want to change the colourmap, for example to
  Green, and increase the transparency (with the transparency slider)
  so that when you load the stats image in, it is easier to see.

<p>Finally, load the stats image in. If you have used TFCE-based
  testing in randomise, the raw t-statistic image will be named
  something like <code>tbss_tstat1</code> (which you could view to see
  raw tstats before significance testing), but the image you probably
  want is <code>tbss_tfce_corrp_tstat1</code>, which is the corrected
  p-value image (actually the values in this image are 1-p for ease of
  display, so that bigger is "better"). Load this into FSLView, set a
  colourmap such as Red-Yellow, and set the display range to something
  like 0.95:1, which corresponds to thresholding the results at
  p<0.05.

<p>All of the above (apart from setting the skeleton transparency,
  which has to be done by hand in the GUI) can be carried out with a
  single command (see first example image):

<p><code>fslview $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm mean_FA_skeleton -l Green -b 0.2,0.7 tbss_tfce_corrp_tstat1 -l Red-Yellow -b 0.95,1</code>

<p><img src="stats_eg2.png" align="right">Alternatively, although
  showing the stats results on the TBSS skeleton is a true
  representation of the actual analysis carried out, some people find
  it easier to visualise the results if the skeletonised results are
  "thickened" somewhat. In order to make such a presentation easy,
  there is a script <code>tbss_fill</code>, which thickens the
  thresholded stats image, filling it out into the local "tracts" seen
  in mean_FA. For example, to apply this to the same example as above
  and then view in FSLView on top of the mean_FA image, run:

<p><code>tbss_fill tbss_tfce_corrp_tstat1 0.95 mean_FA tbss_fill<br>
fslview mean_FA -b 0,0.6 mean_FA_skeleton -l Green -b 0.2,0.7 tbss_fill -l Red-Yellow</code>

  and show where, in each subject's Fa image, those voxels originally
  came from. This "back projection" is composed of one or two
  steps. First, the skeleton voxel is projected back from its position
  on the skeleton to the nearby position at the centre of the nearest
  tract in the subject's FA image in standard space (i.e., after the
  FA image had been nonlinearly registered to the target
  image). Second, this point can then be "inverse warped" back into
  the subject's native space, by inverting the nonlinear registration
  that was originally applied. The whole process can be viewed thus:

<p>There are two obvious reasons why you might want to back-project a
  skeleton-space voxel (or voxels). The first is to confirm that a
  given skeleton point was derived from the correct tract-centre
  points in all subjects. This can generally be achieve by just taking
  the first of the back projection steps, from the skeleton to the
  space of the all_FA data, and viewing the back-projected points on
  top of all_FA (looking at each subject, i.e., timepoint,
  separately). The second is to take a skeleton-space voxel or set of
  voxels (for example, a skeleton-space blob that is significantly
  different between the two groups of subjects in the study) back to
  the space of the original subjects' data, in order to run
  tractography for each subject, with that result forming the
  tractography seed mask.

<p><b>Option 1: just deproject &lt;skeleton-space-input-image&gt; onto the
    space of each nonlinearly registered subject in all_FA</b>

<p>For an example of confirming the final tract-centre projection
  stage, first form an image containing significant voxels from a
  previous randomise-based statistical analysis of the skeletonised
  data:

<p><pre>fslmaths tbss_tfce_corrp_tstat1 -thr 0.95 grot
tbss_deproject grot 1
fslview all_FA grot_to_all_FA -l Red-Yellow</pre>

<p>The <code>1</code> tells the script to just apply stage 1 of the
  de-projections, i.e. from skeleton space to the all_FA space. This
  lets you view the interesting skeleton-space voxels in the space of
  each subject's standard space (nonlinearly registered) FA image - as
  you move through the timepoints in FSLView you see each subject in
  turn.

<p><b>Option 2: do the first step and also invert the nonlinear warping, to
get back to subjects' native space</b>

<p>For an example of complete back-projection to the space of the
native data in FA, run the following, first making sure you run the
command from within the <code>stats</code> directory. The
<code>2</code> flag tells the script to take the back-projection back
to the native space:

<p><pre>tbss_deproject grot 2</pre>

<p>This results in a separate output for each subject in the
<code>stats</code> directory. For example, if your first subject was
called <code>subject_001</code>, you would view the results (if you
are in the <code>stats</code> directory), with:

<p><code>fslview ../FA/subject_001_FA subject_001_FA_grot -l Red-Yellow</code>

<p>This is probably the space you want to transform <code>grot</code>
into if you are going to use the result to seed tractography analysis.

<p>Finally, you can add the <code>-n</code> flag to the end of the
<code>tbss_deproject</code> command to tell the transformations of
your original skeleton voxels to keep the exact values in your input
data (rather than allowing them to be smoothly interpolated) when
applying the reverse transformations. For example, if your skeleton-space
image that you feed into <code>tbss_deproject</code> contains mask
index numbers 1, 2 and 3 at different mask locations on the skeleton,
you would use the <code>-n</code> option, and then the output images
from <code>tbss_deproject</code> will contain the same set of index
numbers without any alteration cause by the interpolations. Note that
this will take a long time to run if you have lots of distinct integer
values in the input image, as the deprojections are run separately for
every different index number! If your data has continuous values
(e.g. Z-statistic or p-values) you should not use the <code>-n</code>
option.

<!-- {{{ what's new -->

<a name="new"></a><p><hr><H2>What's new in this version</H2>

<p><b>v1.2</b>

<p>This version switched the nonlinear registration from using IRTK to
  using <a href=../fnirt/index.html>FNIRT</a> (FMRIB's Nonlinear
  Registration Tool) and as a result there are some minor usage
  changes. FNIRT is about 15 times faster than IRTK on FA data and
  possibly a little more 'accurate'. A TBSS v1.2 analysis
  is <b>not</b> compatible with an older analysis; the data needs to
  be re-processed starting with running tbss_1_preproc (re-running
  earlier steps such as eddy correction and dtifit is not
  necessary). The usage changes are:

<p>tbss_1_preproc now doesn't need a scaling factor to be chosen; FA
  images no longer need to be converted to be in the range 0:10000.

<p>It is no longer necessary to run tbss_1_preproc before feeding
  non-FA images into TBSS; the data just needs to be named correctly
  and put in the right place (see manual).

<p>The threshold entered for tbss_4_prestats is now in the same units
  as FA, e.g. 0.2, and no longer scaled up by a factor of 10000.

<p><b>v1.1</b>

<p>This version introduced a standard-space mean FA image (FMRIB58_FA)
for use as the target in the initial nonlinear registration. This now
becomes the recommended target for the nonlinear registrations,
instead of registering every subject to every other subject, and
choosing the most typical. All scripts are updated to allow either way
of running the registrations.

<p>Script <code>tbss_fill</code> is added to allow "thickening" of
  results for ease of display.

<p>Script <code>tbss_deproject</code> is added to allow
back-projection of skeleton-space voxels into all_FA and native FA
spaces.

<p><b>v1.0</b>

<p>Original TBSS release.
