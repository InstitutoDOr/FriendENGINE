/* The Log class allows for instantiation of more than one Log
either sharing directories or not. However, Logs can not share log files.
Or you can work with the LogSIngleton class.

A Log can open new logfiles in the same log directory or start on an
entirely new directory. You can stream directly to a Log with flags   
determining streaming to the Logfile and/or cout. */
