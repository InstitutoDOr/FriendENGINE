<H2>OVERLAY</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<p>This tool allows you to combine a background image (raw FMRI or
high resolution MRI) image with one or two statistics images. The
statistics image(s) must be in registration with the background
image.

<p>The different programs are:
<UL>
<LI><b>Renderstats</b> - GUI<br>
<LI><b>overlay</b> - command-line program which does the
actual combining of the input images and produces the colour rendered
output image<br>
<LI><b>create_lut</b> - command-line program which produces colour
look-up-tables (these tell viewer programs such as slicer how to produce different
colours given a colour-rendered image).
</UL>

<H3>Renderstats GUI</H3>

<p>Select all of the images, and then enter a threshold (<b>Min</b>)
for the stats image(s). Any stats values below this will not appear in
the colour rendered output. Any stats above <b>Max</b> <i>will</i>
appear, all with the same colour as the <b>Max</b> value gets (ie
yellow or light blue). You don't need to change the "Min" and "Max"
settings unless you want to vary the display range - for example if
the background image looks very dark when scaled to its min and max.

<p>The <b>colourmap type</b> option lets you choose <b>Solid
colours</b> (you don't see any sign of the background images within
the colour blobs) or <b>Transparent colours</b> (you will see through
the colour blobs to the background intensity).

<p>In general the intensity values within colour rendered images bear
no simple relationship to the original stats values. However, in the
case of rendering <b>Solid</b> colours with <b>Floating point</b>
output type, the red-yellow blobs <i>will</i> contain the actual
values of the stats input image (but the blue blobs will not).

<p>If you want to do 3D rendering in MEDx with the results of stats
colour rendering, you should use solid colours and choose
<b>Integer</b> output type. Then in the 3D rendering GUI either select
<b>Material Iso-Surface</b> for solid 3D rendering or <b>Transparent
Summation</b> for transparent rendering - the latter option means that
activations just under the cortical surface will be visible. The
images may appear quite dark - in this case you can always brighten
them (after "printing" them to tiff files) using the program "display".




<HR><H2>SLICER</H2>

<p>Standard 2D picture display programs cannot read 3D / 4D
NIFTI/Analyze images. Thus FSL includes SLICER, a set of utilities
which take 3D images and produce 2D pictures of slices from within
these files. These slices can be of axial, coronal or sagittal
orientation. If two input images are specified (instead of just one),
the first image is used as normal, but overlaid in red on top of this
are image edges derived from the second input image. This can be
useful for checking the results of registration.

<p>The NIFTI and Analyze formats do not allow for colour image
information to be stored. However, an unused part of the image header
is used by some FSL programs to store information about suitable
colour maps for use with certain images. For example, the colour
activation images produced by FEAT contain such information. The
programs in SLICER use this to use the right colour map when producing
slice pictures.

<p>The different SLICER programs are:
<UL>

<LI><b>slicer</b> - the main program which takes in one or two input
images and produces as many separate output pictures of slices as are
requested. The basic output options (-x, -y and -z) produce single
slice pictures. The more advanced options (-a, -A and -S) produce
montages of various slices. <b>slicer</b> outputs PPM format pictures.

<br><br><LI><b>slices</b> - a script which calls slicer with three
default axial slices, three sagittal and three coronal, combines all 9
pictures into a single GIF picture and automatically calls the
<b>display</b> program to display this picture.

<br><br><LI><b>slicesdir</b> - a script which takes in a list of
images, and for each one, runs slicer to produce the same 9 default
slicings as described above, combining them into a single GIF
picture. A web page is then created which includes all of the GIF
pictures - ie one for each input image.
