<A NAME="section1"></A><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

Standard functional images, using the EPI sequence, are distorted
due to magnetic field inhomogeneities.  These inhomogeneities are
caused by magnetic susceptibility differences in neighbouring tissues
within the head - particularly for air/bone or air/tissue interfaces
in the sinuses.  Consequently, the functional (EPI) images suffer
from geometrical distortion and signal loss, particularly in the
inferior frontal and temporal regions.

<p>
It is possible to measure the field inhomogeneities with a fieldmap
sequence, use the measured field values to calculate the geometric
distortion and signal loss, and then use the calculated information to
compensate for these artefacts. Compensating for these artefacts is
done by geometrically unwarping the EPI images and by applying
cost-function masking in registrations to ignore areas of signal loss.
<i>Note that areas where signal loss has occurred <b>cannot</b> be restored
with <b>any</b> form of post-processing, as the signal has been lost - only
different acquisition techniques can restore signal in these areas.</i>

<p>
Furthermore, there are two situations where dealing with these
distortions: (1) for correcting motion-dependent changes; and (2) for
registration with non-distorted images (e.g. structurals).  With
FUGUE, <i>only</i> the second case is dealt with.  The issue of
motion-dependent signal changes (due to motion-dependent changes in
field inhomogeneity and distortion directions) is <i>not</i> dealt
with in the current version.

<H3>Fieldmap Acquisition</H3>

<br>
Unfortunately, there is no standard sequence for fieldmap acquisitions
and different scanners return different images.  Normally these
images require processing before they represent images with field values 
in the desired units (of radians/second) in each voxel.

<p>
The most common sequence acquires two images with different echo
times.  The change in MR phase from one image to the other is
proportional to both the field inhomogeneity in that voxel and the
echo time difference.  The field value is therefore given by the
difference in phase between these two images divided by the echo time
difference.  This is true for Spin Echo, Gradient Echo or EPI
sequences.  However, EPI-based fieldmaps suffer from the same
distortions (more or less) as the functional images, while Spin Echo
or Gradient Echo based fieldmap images do not.  Within FSL
you <b>cannot use EPI-based fieldmaps</b> with the standard
processing, and their use in general is very problematic.  We strongly
recommend that Spin Echo or Gradient Echo fieldmap sequences are used
to acquire the images.

<p>
MR phase is the most important quantity in a fieldmap sequence,
whereas in normal imaging this phase is not of interest and is
normally not saved when reconstructing the images.  As a consequence,
raw fieldmap scans are somewhat different from most scans, and may
contain images of complex values, or separate phase and magnitude
images.  Furthermore, some scanners/sites may do the full
reconstruction of acquired scans to yield a real-valued map of field
inhomogeneities (in units of Hz, radians per second, Tesla or ppm).
Alternatively no reconstruction may be done, and the raw phase and
magnitude (or complex) images may be saved instead.  It is important
for each different scanner/site/sequence to know what form your data
is in.  If they have been converted to NIFTI or ANALYZE format, then
you can use the FSL tools (particularly <code>fslinfo</code>) to
determine the types of images present.  To obtain fieldmaps that can
be used within FSL using the FSL tools (in particular, PRELUDE and
FUGUE), please refer to the page on
<a href="feat_fieldmap.html">preparing fieldmaps for FEAT</a>.

<H3>GUI and command line software</H3>

<br>  A GUI
interface exists for applying FUGUE to unwarp images as part of the
FEAT preprocessing options.  We strongly recommend using the pre-stats
part of FEAT to do all such processing (note that it is not necessary to
have fMRI data for this - even single volumes can be processed in FEAT
by selecting pre-stats only).  See the detailed documentation on <a
href="../feat5/detail.html">FEAT</a> and documentation on using
PRELUDE/FUGUE for <a href="feat_fieldmap.html">preparing fieldmaps for
FEAT</a>. 

<P>
The rest of this document gives a brief description of the
individual command line programs available in the FUGUE component of
FSL - used for unwarping geometric distortion in EPI images. 
For each of the programs described here, a full list of available options
can be obtained by running the command with the <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-h</FONT> 
option.

<P>
Note that for all programs the options follow the normal convention that
"single minus" options are separated by a space from their arguments (if any)
whilst "double minus" options are separated by an equals sign and no space.
For example, <br>
<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>prelude -c data --unwrap=result</FONT>
<br> or <br>
<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>prelude --complex=data -u result</FONT>

<A NAME="section2"></A><HR><H2>PRELUDE</H2>
 
<I>prelude</I> (Phase Region Expanding Labeller for Unwrapping
Discrete Estimates) performs 3D phase unwrapping of images.  The input
can either be a single complex image (Analyze or Nifti), or a pair of
real images giving the phase and absolute values separately.  Also
see <a href="../../avwutils/doc/index.html#fslcomplex">fslcomplex</a>
for ways to manipulate complex image formats.

<p>
If the images are 4D images, then each 3D volume is unwrapped
separately, and the result saved as a 4D image of unwrapped phase
images.  The output in either case is a real, unwrapped phase image
(in radians).

<p>
For higher resolution images (e.g. for SWI) a mask should be used in
order to reduce run-times since any areas that include noisy voxels
will significantly increase the required run-time.  The best way to
generate a mask is by running BET to perform brain extraction on the
absolute image.

<P>
The three main forms of usage are:
<dl>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>prelude -c data -u result</FONT>  </dt>
<dd> uses a single complex input file </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>prelude -a data_abs -p data_phase -u result</FONT> </dt>
<dd> uses separate phase and absolute input files </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>prelude -a data_abs -p data_phase -u result -m mask</FONT> </dt>
<dd> uses separate phase and absolute input files with a mask </dd>
</dl>

<P>
Additional options that are useful are:
<dl>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-m mask</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>uses the user defined mask </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-n num</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>specifies the number of phase partitions 
the algorithm uses for labelling - a larger value is likely to be more
robust but slower </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-s</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>unwrap in 2D, then stick slices together
with appropriate offsets - this is less robust but fast - mainly used for
very high-resolution images where speed is an issue </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--labelslices</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>does labelling in 2D, but
unwrapping in 3D - the default for high-res images </dd>
</dl>

<A NAME="section3"></A><HR><H2>FUGUE</H2>
 
<I>fugue</I> (FMRIB's Utility for Geometrically Unwarping EPIs)
performs unwarping of an EPI image based on fieldmap data.  The input
required consists of the EPI image, the fieldmap (as an unwrapped
phase map or a scaled fieldmap in rad/s) and appropriate image
sequence parameters for the EPI and fieldmap acquisitions: the dwell time for EPI (also known as the echo spacing); and the echo time difference (called asym time herein). 

<P>
The main forms of usage are:
<dl>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>fugue -i epi -p unwrappedphase --dwell=dwelltime --asym=asymtime -s 0.5 -u result</FONT> </dt>  
<dd>fieldmap specified by a 4D file unwrappedphase containing two unwrapped
phase images - from different echo times - plus the 
dwell time and echo time difference (asym time) </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>fugue -i epi --dwell=dwelltime --loadfmap=fieldmap -u result</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>uses a previously calculated fieldmap </dd>
</dl>

<P>
Note the option <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-s 0.5</FONT> is an example of how
to specify the regularisation to apply to the fieldmap (2D Gaussian
smoothing of sigma=0.5 in this case which is a reasonable default).
There are many different forms of regularisation available which can
be applied separately or together.  These are:
<dl>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-s sigma</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>2D Gaussian smoothing </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--smooth3=sigma</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>3D Gaussian smoothing </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-m</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>2D median filtering </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--poly=n</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>3D Polynomial fitting of degree n </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--fourier=n</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>3D Sinusoidal fitting of degree n </dd>
</dl>

<P>
Some other uses are:
<dl>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>fugue -i undistortedimage -p unwrappedphase  --dwell=dwelltime --asym=asymtime --nokspace -s 0.5 -w warpedimage</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>applies the fieldmap as a forward warp, turning an undistorted image into a distorted one - useful for creating a registration target for the EPI from the undistorted absolute fieldmap image </dd>
</dl>

<P>
Additional options that are useful are:
<dl>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--mask=maskname</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>uses a user-defined mask (called maskname) instead of deriving it from the phasemaps or fieldmaps</dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--unwarpdir=dir</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>specifies the direction of
the unwarping/warping - i.e. phase-encode direction - with<FONT COLOR=PURPLE> dir</FONT> being one of
<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>x,y,z,x-,y-,z-</FONT> (default is y) </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--phaseconj</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>uses the phase conjugate correction method, rather than pixel shifts </dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--nokspace</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>for forward warping (only) - uses an image-space method for forward warping
</dd>
<dt> <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>--icorr</FONT> </dt> 
<dd>applies an intensity correction term
when using the pixel shift method - often poorly conditioned for standard
fieldmap acquisitions </dd>
</dl>
