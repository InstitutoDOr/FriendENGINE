Miscellaneous FSL Image Utilities
<TD ALIGN=RIGHT><a href="../index.html"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../images/fsl-logo.jpg"></a></TR></TABLE><HR>
 
<P>FSLUTILS is a set of useful command-line utilities which allow the
conversion, processing etc. of Analyze and Nifti format data sets.
Many of them work on both 3D and 4D data. For each of these programs,
type just the program name to get the usage help.


<p>The different FSLUTILS programs are:
<UL>

<LI><b>fsl2ascii</b> - convert image files to ASCII text file (or files if
data is 4D).

<br><br><LI><b>fslcc</b> - run cross-correlations between every volume in
one 4D data set with every volume in another (for investigating
similarities in ICA outputs).

<br><br><LI><b>fslchfiletype</b> - used to change the file type of
an image (e.g. from ANALYZE_GZ to NIFTI).  The first argument is
the desired file type (one of ANALYZE, ANALYZE_GZ, NIFTI, NIFTI_GZ,
NIFTI_PAIR, NIFTI_PAIR_GZ) and the second is the input file.  If
no third argument is given then the input file is converted in place.
This in place conversion removes the original files: e.g. for an
Analyze file called stdimg then
<kbd>fslchfiletype NIFTI_GZ stdimg</kbd> would replace stdimg.hdr and
stdimg.img with stdimg.nii.gz.  Note that having multiple copies of
an image with the same basename and different filetypes (e.g. stdimg.nii.gz
and stdimg.hdr and stdimg.img) creates many problems for determining
what images to read, and in general will cause FSL programs to stop.

<br><br><a name="fslcomplex"></a><LI><b>fslcomplex</b> - a utility that allows 3D or 4D complex
image files to be split or constructed from corresponding real
components (either Cartesian or polar). The initial flag indicates
what kind of processing is done.  In addition, two optional arguments
at the end specify the first and last 3D volumes to be processed when
the input is 4D (default is to do all volumes).

<br><br><LI><b>fslcpgeom</b> - copy certain parts of the header 
information (image
dimensions, voxel dimensions, voxel dimensions units string, image
orientation/origin or qform/sform info) from one image to another.
Note that only copies from Analyze to Analyze or Nifti to Nifti
will work properly.  Copying from different files will result in
loss of information or potentially incorrect settings.

<br><br><LI><b>fslcreatehd</b> - creates a new image header along with
a zero intensity data image.  There are two forms of input: one takes
a list of minimal information on the command line, the other takes in
an xml-style file, as written by <kbd>fslhd -x</kbd>.  The information
required in the first version is: x/y/z/tsize for image dimensions,
x/y/zvoxsize for voxel dimensions (eg in mm), tr in seconds for time
between volumes (for 3D data set to 0), x/y/zorigin for voxel
co-ordinate origin (eg for standard space - otherwise leave as 0 0 0),
datatype for the voxel data type (the commonest are: 1=binary,
2=unsigned char, 4=signed short, 8=signed int, 16=float).  Note that
this is <b><i>different</i></b> from the previous versions in that an
entire image is created, and will <b><i>overwrite</i></b> any
<kbd>.img</kbd> file contents of the same image name.

<br><br><LI><b>fsledithd</b> - allows the header information in
and image to be edited in a text-based xml-style format (like the
output of <kbd>fslhd -x</kbd> but with redundant fields removed
and some help text provided).  Note that
the default text editor used is nano, but other editors can be
specified by the second argument.

<br><br><LI><b>fslfft</b> - outputs the Fast-Fourier Transform (or inverse)
for a complex input volume.

<br><br><LI><b>fslhd</b> - report every field of an Analyze or Nifti
header (note that the fields are different although some are common,
e.g. pixdims).  The option "-x" produces an xml-style output which can
be used in conjunction with <kbd>fslcreatehd</kbd>.  The reported
values are those used internally in FSL programs and are sometimes
different from the raw values stored in the file to avoid incorrect
settings (e.g. dimN has a minimum value of 1, not 0).

<br><br><LI><b>fslinfo</b> - report a basic subset of an Analyze or
Nifti header.

<br><br><LI><b>fslinterleave</b> - interleave two inputs to form a
combined image.

<br><br><LI><b>fslmaths</b> - simple but powerful program to allow
mathematical manipulation of images.  Now includes spatial and
temporal filtering, statistic conversion (e.g. z to p-values),
diffusion tensor decomposition, and TFCE calculation.

<br><br><LI><b>fslmeants</b> - output the average timeseries of a set of voxels, or the individual time series for each of these voxels.

<br><br><LI><b>fslmerge</b> - concatenate image files into a single
output. This concatenation can be in time, or in X, Y or Z. All image
dimensions (except for the one being concatenated over) must be the
same in all input images. For example, this can be used to take
multiple 3D files (eg as output by SPM) and create a single 4D image
file.

<br><br><LI><b>fslnvols</b> - report how many time points are in the
input 4D data set.

<br><br><LI><b>fslpspec</b> - outputs the spectral power density of an
input 4D data set.

<br><br><LI><b>fslroi</b> - extract region of interest (ROI) from an
image. You can a) take a 3D ROI from a 3D data set (or if it is 4D,
the same ROI is taken from each time point and a new 4D data set is
created), b) extract just some time points from a 4D data set, or c)
control time and space limits to the ROI.  Note that the arguments are
minimum index and <i>size</i> (not maximum index).  So to extract
voxels 10 to 12 inclusive you would specify 10 and 3 (not 10 and 12).

<br><br><LI><b>fslslice</b> - split a 3D file into lots of 2D files (along z-axis).

<br><br><LI><b>fslsplit</b> - split a 4D file into lots of 3D files
(eg for inputting to SPM).

<br><br><LI><b>fslstats</b> - report certain summary statistics for an
input 3D/4D image. Of particular value is the "robust intensity range"
which calculates values similar to the 2% and 98% percentiles, but
ensuring that the majority of the intensity range is captured, even
for binary images. In addition, it can take an aribitrary mask as
input so that statistics are only calculated within the mask and can
also generate histogram data.

<br><br><LI><b>fslval</b> - report a particular parameter (given a
particular keyword eg "dim4") from an image header. To see the list of
keywords run <kbd>fslhd</kbd> on the header and look at the first column.

<p>
<hr>

<br><br><LI><b>fslfixfloat</b> - sets all non-finite (NaN, Inf) values
and very small values (<1e-37) to zero, which helps avoid some floating
point errors on Alpha machines.  Note that this is only works for volumes 
with data type = float.

</ul>

<h2>Orientation-related Utilities</h2>
<br>
The following utilities allow you to report and modify the
orientation information in NIFTI files (and ANALYZE to some extent).
For more information about orientation and the NIFTI format see
the <a href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslfaq">FSL FAQ</a>.

<ul>
<LI><b>fslorient</b> - reports or sets the orientation information in
a file.  Note that only in Nifti files can the orientation be changed
- Analyze files are <i>always treated as <b>radiological</b></i>
(meaning that they could be rotated into the same alignment as
the <code>avg152</code> standard images - equivalent to the appropriate
<i>sform</i> or <i>qform</i> in a Nifti file having a negative
determinant).

<p>In Nifti files it is possible to independently report or modify
the <i>qform</i> or <i>sform</i> fields.  However, the FSL4.1 output
routines will try to keep
<i>qform and sform matrices the same</i> whenever one would otherwise
be unset.  Therefore it is not possible, for instance, to delete only
the qform, as if the sform is set then doing this will result in the
qform being set equal (or nearly equal) to the sform.  This is
currently done to aid interoperability with other packages.  However, if both
qform and sform are given different values then these are
preserved by the output routines.

<p>This command does not change the data storage at all - only the
orientation information in the header.

<br><br><LI><b>fslswapdim</b> - re-orders the data storage to permit
changes between axial, sagittal and coronal slicing.  When used in this
mode the same left-right convention (also called coordinate handedness or radiological/neurological convention) will be maintained <i>as long as no warning is printed</i>.

<p>The new orientation of the data is specified by selecting what the
new axes should represent.  This can either be done in terms of the
old axes (<kbd>x y z -x -y -z</kbd>) or in terms of anatomical labels
<i>when this information is available</i> (in a Nifti image where
either the sform or qform is set).  The anatomical labels are RL LR AP
PA SI IA.  This latter form is the most convenient to achieve a given
orientation.  For example: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <kbd>fslswapdim
invol RL PA IS outvol</kbd> <br>will create a volume <kbd>outvol</kbd>
with axial slicing the same as the standard template images.  Note
that the anatomical label version will not allow the left-right
convention to be changed.

<p>
Ordinarily <kbd>fslswapdim</kbd> will change the orientation
information in the header as well as reordering the data.  This is so
that the anatomical labels stay attached to the same parts of the
image and not fixed to the voxel coordinates.  Hence, reordering a
coronal image to axial slicing should keep the labels correctly
attached to the relevant parts of the image, as long as they were
correct initially.  If the initial labels are incorrect (see the
labels in <kbd>fslview</kbd> or <kbd>fslhd</kbd>) then
<kbd>fslorient</kbd> needs to be used in conjunction with
<kbd>fslswapdim</kbd> in order to correct this.

<p>
When <kbd>fslswapdim</kbd> is given arguments that will change the
left-right orientation it will issue a warning that the left-right
orientation is being flipped.  It will also try to modify the
orientation information in the header, but <i>not</i> in a way that
swaps this left-right orientation in the header.  Hence there is a net
change in orientation as the data is swapped while the header is not.
If the swap occurs on the x-axis then nothing is done to the header at
all.  Otherwise, the axis which is being swapped, together with the
x-axis, have their orientation changed.  In this way the handedness of
the header is preserved, the labels associated with the y-axis and
z-axis follow the image change, but the x-axis labels do not.  It is
recommended that if a left-right swap is desired (and this should only
be done if the reconstruction is initially incorrect) then the
arguments <kbd>-x y z</kbd> should be used as this is the simplest
form of swapping since it only affects the x-axis data and no labels
or header information is changed.


</UL>

<hr>
<p>Major change from FSL3.3: all programs previously called
<b>avwsomething</b> are now called <b>fslsomething</b>. All old C
programs have now been replaced with C++ programs, hence all programs
with a "++" at the end of the name have had the "++" removed.
