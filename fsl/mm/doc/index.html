<p>Mixture modelling is an alternative method of carrying out
inference on (i.e., thresholding) statistical maps such as t, f or z
stat images output by FEAT. Instead of just making assumptions about
the null part of the statistical distribution and making all inference
with respect to that, mixture modelling explicitly models the null
part <i>and</i> the activation part. We can thus carry out "alternate
hypothesis testing" and ask a richer set of questions of the
data. Here we also implement a <i>spatial</i> enhancement to the
mixture modelling; we use a spatial Markov random field to regularise
(smooth) the labelling of voxels into null, activated or
"de"-activated.

<P>For more detail on the spatial mixture modelling see <i>Mixture
Models with Adaptive Spatial Regularisation for Segmentation with an
Application to FMRI Data; Woolrich, M., Behrens, T., Beckmann, C., and
Smith, S.; IEEE Trans. Medical Imaging, 24(1):1-11, 2005</i> and a

<HR><H2>mm</H2>

<p>Warning: this implementation of spatial mixture modelling is a beta
release and has not been extensively tested! To run spatial mixture
modelling on a statistic image (such as grot.feat/stats/zstat1) use
the <b>mm</b> command-line
program. The minimum syntax is:
<pre>mm --mask=&lt;mask_image&gt; --sdf=&lt;stats_image&gt;</pre>
and the other main option that you might want to use is
<b>--zfstatmode</b> which tells mm not to fit a deactivation
class. Just type <b>mm</b> to get the full help output.

<p>The output from mm is summarised in a web-page named
&lt;outputdir&gt;/MM.html and the probability of lying in each of the
two or three segmentation classes (null, activation and de-activation)
are found in &lt;outputdir&gt;/w1_mean, w2_mean and w3_mean. Note that
the histogram plot in the web-page report will look less "nice" a fit
than a non-spatial mixture model. This is because the final fitting is
a balance between optimal histogram fitting of the class mixtures and
the spatial processes which attempt to smooth voxel classification.
