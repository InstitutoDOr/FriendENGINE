/* {{{ background theory */

/*

consider the GLM:

Y = Xb + E

consider a single voxel, in which case Y (data) and X (model) and E
(residuals) are column vectors (ie time series)

we generate a prewhitening matrix S which makes the residuals white:

SY = SXb + SE

(SPM also uses this form, but in the case of SPM, S is not a whitening
matrix but a colouring matrix, so that instead of the resulting
residuals being white, they contain an amount of autcorrelation which
is approximately known and can be corrected for in the inference.)

S is a Toeplitz matrix

S =   / r0  r1  r2  r3  r4  ....... \
     |  r-1 r0  r1  r2  r3  ....... |
     |  r-2 r-1 r0  r1  r2  ....... |
     |  r-3 r-2 r-1 r0  r1  ....... |
        ...........................
        ...........................
        ...........................
     |  ....... r-2 r-1 r0  r1  r2  |
     |  ....... r-3 r-2 r-1 r0  r1  |
     \  ....... r-4 r-3 r-2 r-1 r0  /

this is in theory equivalent to convolving the time series in a column
vector (Y or X or E) with 1D convolution kernel r[i];

SY[i] = SUM(r[j-i] * Y[j])

the difference in practice is that it is easier to sort out
end-effects (padding of the data to allow simple processing with a
constant width convolution kernel) if this is seen as a convolution
rather than matrix multiplication. In fact, the convolution is
normally carried out in fourier space (ie a fourier space
multiplication rather than real space convolution) for computational
efficiency.


***********************************************************

generating prewhitening matrix S:

E = N(0,sigma^2 V)

where V is the autocorrelation matrix

use Cholesky to get K where V=KK'

so if we set S = K^-1

there are more details in Mark's report which we've just put on the web:
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/techrep/tr01mw1/tr01mw1/node3.html

in detail:

1) fit model to data and remove that part of signal which correlates.
2) take resulting residuals and estimate autocorrelation parameters
3) regularise these by applying a Tukey taper and the smoothing spatially with the estimates at neighbouring voxels
4) create S=K^-1 by inverting the autocorrelation estimates in the spectral domain
5) Use S to prewhiten data and model, and refit.

again - there is more detail in the paper (and the source code ;-)
