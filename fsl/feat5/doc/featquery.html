<H1>Featquery - FEAT Results Interrogation</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>Featquery is a tool which allows you to interrogate FEAT results
within a mask or at a given co-ordinate. The mask/co-ordinate can be
in standard-space, highres-space or lowres-space. Within this mask (or
at the given co-ordinate), Featquery calculates a number of image and
timeseries statistics. For example, you might define a standard-space
mask for the motor cortex, and Featquery will tell you the mean (and
peak) % signal change associated with your modelled experimental
paradigm within that area.

<hr><H2>Choosing FEAT directories to interrogate</H2>

<p>First you must select a previously-created FEAT output directory
whose results you wish to investigate. You can run multiple queries by
changing the <b>Number of FEAT directories</b> from the default of
1. The results of running Featquery will be saved in a directory (by
default named "featquery") inside each FEAT directory that you select
here. If you have already run Featquery on a FEAT directory, a "+"
will be appended to the Featquery output name, e.g. "featquery+".

<hr><H2>Choosing stats images to investigate</H2>

<p>Once you have selected a FEAT directory, a list of stats images
inside that FEAT directory will appear. Click the buttons next to those
that you are interested in. For each of these in turn, Featquery will
calculate various quantities within the selected mask, for example,
the number of non-zero voxels within the mask, the mean and max values
of the stats image within the mask, and the co-ordinates of the max
image value within the mask.

<hr><H2>Setting up a mask or voxel co-ordinates</H2>

<p>You must now choose a <b>Mask image</b>. This would normally be a
binary image in standard-space, highres-space or lowres-space, with a
region-of-interest (ROI), for example, the visual cortex, created by
any method (e.g. hand-drawn or activation from a multi-subject
higher-level FEAT analysis). Featquery will automatically detect which
space this mask is in (standard-space, highres-space or lowres-space)
and will transform it into the native lowres space of example_func; of
course this can only work if FEAT registration was setup and carried
out.

<p>If you want a different mask for each selected FEAT directory,
specify a mask name as a relative filename (i.e., without a "/"). This
mask will then be looked for in each FEAT directory.

<p>Alternatively, you can specify a single co-ordinate (in voxels or
mm) at which to extract values from the chosen stats images. This
still requires a "mask" image to be chosen, as the co-ordinate is
specified in the space of the mask. Thus if you want the co-ordinates
to be in lowres space, just select "mask" or "example_func" from the
FEAT directory. If you want to specify standard-space co-ordinates
(e.g. MNI152 space) then choose "reg/standard". If you choose to
specify the co-ordinate in mm (instead of voxels) and the mask image
is one with a co-ordinate origin set (e.g. reg/standard which by
default is in MNNI152 space, with the origin at the anterior
commissure) then the co-ordinates that you enter will be relative to
this origin, not the corner of the volume.

<p>Finally, you can also automatically generate a mask from one of the
  various standard-space atlases provided with FSL. To do this, select
  an atlas from the menu, and then select a structure by pressing
  the <b>Select label</b> button.

<p>Featquery saves the mask, once transformed into the native space of
the selected FEAT directory, inside the Featquery output directory,
called "mask" (even if this only contains a single non-zero voxel, in
the case of selecting a co-ordinate).

<hr><H2>Further options</H2>

<p>If you select an atlas, extra information will be added into the
  Featquery output. For each stats image, the position of the maximum
  voxel (within the input mask) will be used to query the selected
  atlas, and each structure which overlaps this voxel will be reported
  (for the probabilistic atlases, the % probability for each
  overlapping structure will be given).

<p>If you select <b>Convert PE/COPE values to % (VARCOPE to %^2)</b>,
any PE or COPE parameter estimate or contrast values will be converted
to percentage signal change values before reporting. This is achieved
by scaling the PE or COPE values by (100*) the peak-peak height of the
regressor (or effective regressor in the case of COPEs) and then by
dividing by mean_func (the mean over time of filtered_func_data). If
you are running Featquery on a higher-level FEAT directory, mean_func
is the mean of all the lower-level mean_func images, so the % change
values are reported correctly. For VARCOPE variance images, the
equivalent transformation is also made, this time in units of %
squared (i.e., take the square root to compare with the size of the
COPE % change).

<!-- % signal change at higher-level N (%N): -->
<!-- %N = HconN * 100 * mean(HconN-1) * COPEN ./ mean(I0) -->

<p>If you turn on <b>Do not binarise mask (allow weighting)</b> then
if your mask is non-binary, its non-zero values will weight all
Featquery output values rather than treating the mask as binary. In
this case the mask will be scaled such that its mean (over non-zero
voxels) is 1.

<p>If you have selected a mask image in standard or highres space,
this will get transformed into lowres space as described above. This
involves interpolation; at the edges of the mask there will be a
continuous range of values from 1 down to 0. In order to get back to a
binary mask, this must be thresholded at some value - the default is
0.5. However, if you want the mask to be slightly more or less
inclusive than that default, you can <b>Change post-interpolation
thresholding of mask</b> - for example, by reducing the value to 0.3,
the final lowres mask will be slightly larger.

<p>If, as well as masking the stats images that you selected above,
you want to only consider voxels from the images that are above above
a given threshold, then turn on <b>Threshold stats images as well as
masking</b> and select a value.

<p>By default the output from Featquery is saved in a directory called
"featquery", created inside each selected original FEAT directory (or
is called "featquery+", etc., if you have already run Featquery
before). At <b>Featquery output directory name</b> you can change this
default name to anything else in order to more easily distinguish
different runs of Featquery.

<hr><H2>Go</H2>

<p>When you press <b>Go</b>, Featquery produces a web page report with
all requested stats, as well as a raw text version of the main report
table. Above the main table are links to "Mean time series
(masked/weighted)" (this is a raw text file containing the mean time
series, within the mask, of the 4D data file filtered_func_data) and
"Masked time series plots" (this is a full graphical time series
report, similar to those shown in the FEAT report, but with everything
masked by the Featquery mask/co-ordinate, including peri-stimulus
plots).

<hr><H2>Featquery output</H2>

<p>The first column in the main table shows the "stats image",
i.e. lists the different FEAT stats images that you asked Featquery to
report on; each of these is also a link to a raw text file giving the
data timeseries plot at the position of the maximum image value within
the mask. The next column tells you the number of non-zero voxels
within the mask.

<p>The next group of columns give various statistics derived from each
image's values within the Featquery mask. Most of these are
self-explanatory (min, mean, median, max); the 10% and 90% columns
show the image values at 10% and 90% of the way through the ordered
list of values (i.e., at 10%/90% of the cumulative distribution
function) - so these could be considered a "robust range" of the data
values, ignoring the tails/outliers of the distribution.

<p>The final group of columns gives the co-ordinates of the maximum
image voxel within the Featquery mask, both in voxels in native space
and in mm in standard space (assuming that FEAT registration was run),
as well as overlapping atlas strucures, if requested.

<hr><H2>Scripting the running of Featquery and the extraction of
  values generated by Featquery</H2>

<p>When you press <b>Go</b>, if you started the Featquery GUI from a
command-line terminal then you will see the command-line call to
the <b>featquery</b> script that is made. You can easily adapt this to
script Featquery, if you want to make lots of calls to featquery
automatically. Type "featquery" to get the full command-line usage.

<p>It is easy to extract data from the raw text output, using unix
commands like grep and awk. For example, to extract the "# featdir"
value (column 1) and the median (column 7) of the "cope2" image, you
might use:<pre>
cat ~/grot.feat/featquery/report.txt | grep stats/cope2 | awk '{print $1 " " $7}'</pre>
