<H2>Appendix A: Brief Overview of GLM Analysis</H2>

<p>General Linear Modelling (more correctly known simply as "linear
modelling") sets up a model (i.e., what you expect to see in the data)
and fits it to the data. If the model is derived from the stimulation
that was applied to the subject in the MRI scanner, then a good fit
between the model and the data means that the data was indeed caused
by the stimulation.

<p>The GLM used here is univariate. This means that the model is fit
to each voxel's time-course separately. (Multivariate would mean that a
much more complex analysis would take place on all voxels' time-courses
at the same time, and interactions between voxels would be taken into
account. Independent Component Analysis - ICA - is an example of
multivariate analysis.) For the rest of this section, you can imagine
that we are only talking about one voxel, and the fitting of the model
to that voxel's timecourse. Thus the data comprises a single 1D vector
of intensity values.

<p>A very simple example of linear modelling is
<b>y(t)=a*x(t)+b+e(t)</b>. <b>y(t)</b> is the data, and is a 1D vector
of intensity values - one for each time point, i.e., is a function of
time. <b>x(t)</b> is the model, and is also a 1D vector with one value
for each time point. In the case of a square-wave block design,
<b>x(t)</b> might be a series of 1s and 0s - for example, 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 etc. <b>a</b> is the parameter estimate for
<b>x(t)</b>, i.e., the value that the square wave (of height 1) must
be multiplied by to fit the square wave component in the
data. <b>b</b> is a constant, and in this example, would correspond to
the baseline (rest) intensity value in the data. <b>e</b> is the error
in the model fitting.

<p>If there are two types of stimulus, the model would be
<b>y=a1*x1+a2*x2+b+e</b>. Thus there are now two different model
waveforms, corresponding to the two stimulus timecourses. There are
also two interesting parameters to estimate, <b>a1</b> and
<b>a2</b>. Thus if a particular voxel reponds strongly to model
<b>x1</b> the model-fitting will find a large value for <b>a1</b>; if
the data instead looks more like the second model timecourse,
<b>x2</b>, then the model-fitting will give <b>a2</b> a large value.

<p><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="dm1.gif" ALT="Example design matrix">GLM is
normally formulated in matrix notation. Thus all of the parameters are
grouped together into a vector <b>A</b>, and all of the model
timecourses are grouped together into a matrix <b>X</b>. However, it
isn't too important to follow the matrix notation, except to
understand the layout of the design matrix, which is the matrix
<b>X</b>. The main part of the image shown here contains two such
model timecourses. Each column is a different model timecourse, with
time going down the image vertically. Thus the left column is
<b>x1</b>, for example, the timecourse associated with visual
stimulation, and the right column is <b>x2</b>, e.g., auditory
stimulation, which has a different timecourse to the visual
stimulation. Note that each column has two representations of the
model's value - the black->white intensity shows the value, as does
the red line plot. Make sure that you are comfortable with both
representations.

<p>When the model is fit to the data, for each voxel there will be
found an estimate of the "goodness of fit" of each column in the
model, to that voxel's timecourse. In the visual cortex, the first
column will generate a high first parameter estimate, and the second
column will generate a low second parameter estimate, as this part of
the model will not fit the voxel's timecourse well. Each column will
be known as an explanatory variable (EV), and in general represents a
different stimulus type.

<p>To convert estimates of parameter estimates (PEs) into statistical
maps, it is necessary to divide the actual PE value by the error in
the estimate of this PE value. This results in a <b>t</b> value. If
the PE is low relative to its estimated error, the fit is not
significant. Thus <b>t</b> is a good measure of whether we can believe
the estimate of the PE value. All of this is done separately for each
voxel. To convert a <b>t</b> value into a <b>P</b> (probability) or
<b>Z</b> statistic requires standard statistical transformations;
however, <b>t</b>, <b>P</b> and <b>Z</b> all contain the same
information - they tell you how significantly the data is related to a
particular EV (part of the model). <b>Z</b> is a "Gaussianised
<b>t</b>", which means that a Z statistic of 2 is 2 standard
deviations away from zero.

<p>As well as producing images of <b>Z</b> values which tell you how
strongly each voxel is related to each EV (one image per EV), you can
compare parameter estimates to see if one EV is more "relevant" to the
data than another. This is known as contrasting EVs, or producing
contrasts. To do this, one PE is subtracted from another, a combined
standard error is calculated, and a new Z image is created. All of the
above is controlled by you, by setting up contrasts. Each output Z
statistic image is generated by setting up a contrast vector; thus set
the number of outputs that you want. To convert a single EV into a Z
statistic image, set it's contrast value to 1 and all others to
0. Thus the simplest design, with one EV only, has just one contrast
vector, and only one entry in this contrast vector: 1. To compare two
EVs, for example, to subtract one stimulus type (EV 1) from another
type (EV 2), set EV 1's contrast value to -1 and EV 2's to 1. A Z
statistic image will be generated according to this request, answering
the question "where is the response to stimulus 2 significantly
greater than the response to stimulus 1?"

<p>The bottom part of the above image shows the requested contrasts;
each column refers to the weighting of the relevant EV (often either
just 1, 0 or -1), and each row is a different contrast vector. Thus
each row will result in it's own Z statistic image. Here the contrasts
are [1 0] and [0 1]. Thus the first Z stat image produced will show
response to stimulus type 1, relative to rest, and the second will
show the response to stimulus type 2.

<p><IMG WIDTH=150 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="dm2.gif" ALT="Example design matrix">If you want to model
nonlinear interactions between two EVs (for example, when you expect
the response to two different stimuli when applied simultaneously to
give a greater response than predicted by adding up the responses to
the stimuli when applied separately), then an extra EV is
necessary. The simplest way of doing this is to setup the two
originals EVs, and then add an interaction term, which will only be
"up" when both of the original EVs are "up", and "down" otherwise. In
the example image, EV 1 could represent the application of drug, and
EV 2 could represent visual stimulation. EV 3 will model the extent to
which drug+visual is greater than the sum of drug-only and
visual-only. The third contrast will show this measure, whilst the
fourth contrast [0 0 -1] shows where negative interaction is
occurring.

<p>All of the EVs have to be independent of each other. This means
that no EV can be a sum (or weighted sum) of other EVs in the
design. The reason for this is that the maths which are used to fit
the model to the data does not work properly unless the design matrix
is of "full rank", i.e. all EVs are independent. A common mistake is
to model both rest and activation waveforms, making one an upside-down
version of the other; in this case EV 2 is -1 times EV 1, and
therefore linearly dependent on it. It is only necessary to model the
activation waveform.

<p>With "parametric designs", there might be several different levels
of stimulation, and you probably want to find the response to each
level separately. Thus you should use a separate EV for each
stimulation level. (If, however, you are very confident that you know
the form of the response, and are not interested in confirming this,
then you can create a custom waveform which will match the different
stimulation levels, and only use one EV.) If you want to create
different contrasts to ask different questions about these responses,
then: [1 0 0] shows the response of level 1 versus rest (likewise [0 1
0] for level 2 vs rest and [0 0 1] for level 3). [-1 1 0] shows where
the response to level 2 is greater than that for level 1. [-1 0 1]
shows the general linear increase across all three levels. [1 -2 1]
shows where the increase across all three levels deviates from being
linear (this is derived from (l3-l2)-(l2-l1)=l3-2*l2+l1).

<p>Thus there often exists a natural hierarchy in contrast vectors. In
the above example, [1 1 1] shows overall activation, [-1 0 1] shows
linear increase in activation and [1 -2 1] shows (quadratic) deviation
from the linear trend. Note that each contrast is orthogonal to the
others (e.g. -1*1 + 0*1 + 1*1 = 0) - this is important as it means
that each is independent of the others. A common mistake might be, for
example, to model the linear trend with [1 2 3], which is wrong as it
mixes the average activation with the linear increase.
