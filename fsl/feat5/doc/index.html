<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>For other information on FEAT and updated journal references, see
the <A HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/feat/"
target="_top">FEAT web page</A>. If you use FEAT in your research,
please quote the journal references listed there.

<p>FEAT is a software tool for high quality model-based FMRI data
analysis, with an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). FEAT is
part of <a href="../index.html" target="_top">FSL</a> (FMRIB's
Software Library). FEAT automates as many of the analysis decisions as
possible, and allows easy (though still robust, efficient and valid)
analysis of simple experiments whilst giving enough flexibility to
also allow sophisticated analysis of the most complex experiments.

<p>Analysis for a simple experiment can be set up in less than 1
minute, whilst a highly complex experiment need take no longer than 5
minutes to set up. The FEAT programs then typically take 5-20 minutes
to run (per first-level session), producing a web page analysis
report, including colour activation images and time-course plots of
data vs model.

<p>The data modelling which FEAT uses is based on general linear
modelling (GLM), otherwise known as multiple regression. It allows you
to describe the experimental design; then a model is created that
should fit the data, telling you where the brain has activated in
response to the stimuli. In FEAT, the GLM method used on first-level
(time-series) data is known as FILM (FMRIB's Improved Linear
Model). FILM uses a robust and accurate nonparametric estimation of
time series autocorrelation to prewhiten each voxel's time series;
this gives improved estimation efficiency compared with methods that
do not pre-whiten. 

<p>FEAT saves many images to file - various filtered data, statistical
output and colour rendered output images - into a separate FEAT output
directory for each session. If you want to re-run the final stages of
analysis ("Post-stats"), you can do so without re-running any of the
computationally intensive parts of FEAT, by telling FEAT to look in a
FEAT directory for all of the raw statistical images which it needs to
do this. The results of this re-run of the final stages either
overwrite the old ones, or optionally are put in a new FEAT directory,
named similarly to the original FEAT directory, but with an extra "+"
included in the name.

<p>FEAT can also carry out the registration of the low resolution
functional images to a high resolution scan, and registration of the
high resolution scan to a standard (e.g. MNI152)
image. Registration is carried out using <a href="../flirt/index.html"
target="_top">FLIRT</a>.

<p>For higher-level analysis (e.g. analysis across sessions or across
subjects) FEAT uses FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed
Effects). FLAME uses very sophisticated methods for modelling and
estimating the random-effects component of the measured inter-session
mixed-effects variance, using MCMC sampling to get an accurate
estimation of the true random-effects variance and degrees of freedom
at each voxel.


<p>There is a brief overview of GLM analysis in <a
href="glm.html">Appendix A</a> and an overview of how the design matrix is
setup in FEAT in <a href="dm.html">Appendix B</a>.
