<H2>FEAT Basics</H2>

<p>To call the FEAT GUI, either type <b>Feat</b> in a terminal
  (type <b>Feat_gui</b> on Mac or Windows), or
  run <b>fsl</b> and press the <b>FEAT</b> button.

<p>Now set the filename of the 4D input image
(e.g. <b>/users/sibelius/origfunc.nii.gz</b>) by pressing <b>Select 4D
data</b>. You can setup FEAT to process many input images, one after
another, as long as they all require exactly the same analysis. Each
one will generate its own FEAT directory, the name of which is based
on the input data's filename (unless you enter an <b>Output
directory</b> name). 

<p>Note that if you later run <b>Post-stats</b> or
<b>Registration</b>, or if you are running
<b>Higher-level Analysis</b>, then instead of selecting 4D data as the
input, you select FEAT directories. In this case first set the top two
drop-down menus in the GUI and then select the FEAT directory or
directories; it is important to select the FEAT directories before
setting up anything else in FEAT. This is because quite a lot of FEAT
settings are loaded from the first selected FEAT directory, possibly
over-writing any settings which you might wish to change!

<p><b>Total volumes</b> (including volumes to be deleted) is
automatically set from the input files chosen.

<p>Now set <b>Delete volumes</b>. These should be the volumes that are
not wanted because steady-state imaging is not reached for
typically two or three volumes. These volumes are deleted as soon as
FEAT is started, so any 4D data output by FEAT will not contain the
deleted volumes. Note that <b>Delete volumes</b> should not be used to
correct for the time lag between stimulation and the measured response
- this is corrected for in the design matrix by convolving the input
stimulation waveform with a blurring-and-delaying haemodynamic
response function. Most importantly, remember when setting up the
design matrix that the timings in the design matrix start at t=0
seconds, and this corresponds to the start of the first image taken
after the deleted scans. In other words, the design matrix starts
<b>after</b> the deleted scans have been deleted.

<p>Set the <b>TR</b> (time from the start of one volume to the start
of the next).

<p>Now set the <b>High pass filter cutoff</b> point (seconds), that
is, the longest temporal period that you will allow. A sensible
setting in the case of an rArA or rArBrArB type block design is the
(r+A) or (r+A+r+B) total cycle time. For event-related designs the
rule is not so simple, but in general the cutoff can typically be
reduced at least to 50s.

<p>Note that most of the timing inputs in FEAT are set in seconds, not
volumes. <b>Total volumes</b> and <b>Delete volumes</b> are
exceptions.

<p>Now click on the <b>Stats</b> tab and setup the model and required
contrasts (for more detail see below).

<p>When FEAT setup is complete and the <b>Go</b> button is pressed,
the setup gets saved in a temporary FEAT setup file. Then a script
(called <b>feat</b> - note the lower case) is run which uses the setup
file and carries out all the FMRI analysis steps asked for, starting
by creating a FEAT results directory, and copying the setup file into
here, named <b>design.fsf</b> (this setup file can be later loaded
back into FEAT using the <b>Load</b> button).

<p>Once the script has started running you can <b>Exit</b> the FEAT
GUI. The analysis will continue until completion, by default showing
information about its progress in a web browser.
