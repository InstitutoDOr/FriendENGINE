<H2>FEAT - Perfusion FMRI Analysis</H2>

<hr><H3>Introduction</H3>

<p>It is straighforward to analyse perfusion FMRI data (often also
  referred to as ASL or arterial spin labelling) with FEAT. The data
  needs special treatment because each voxel's timeseries alternates
  between "tag" and "control" conditions, with control timepoints
  having higher intensity. If there is BOLD signal present (for
  example because the echo time is not short) this can be modelled as
  the average of the tag and control. The perfusion (flow) signal can
  be modelled as the difference between the tag and control
  conditions; when there is activation, this difference increases.

<p>There are currently two ways of analysing such data with FEAT -
  <b>subtraction</b> of tag from control (as part of pre-stats
  processing), <i>or</i> <b>full perfusion signal modelling</b>, where
  separate EVs model the BOLD signal, the (constant-height)
  tag-control difference and the modulation of this by the
  activation. The choice of which approach to take will depend on the
  data - subtraction can be better if there is certain structured
  noise in the data, whilst full modelling can give more accurate
  modelling, as the data does not have to be resampled, so no
  information is lost through interpolation.

<p>With either approach, initial evidence suggests that it is
  worthwhile using highpass filtering (with cutoff set according to
  the same norms as BOLD FMRI analysis).

<H3>Full perfusion signal modelling</H3>

<p>If you want to fully model the different aspects of the perfusion
  data, you will need to setup at least 3 EVs. See the example design
  matrix:

<UL>

<LI> EV1 models the baseline (constant height) control-tag alternating
  intensity variation. This models the difference between control and
  tag conditions when no stimulation is present, i.e., when there is
  no functional activation.

<LI> EV2 models the BOLD signal, which often contaminates the
  perfusion signal, particularly if the TE (echo time) is not
  low. This EV models the slow signal that is the mean of the tag and
  control conditions. It should be setup as you would setup a normal
  BOLD FMRI analysis, with the basic EV timings set according to
  stimulation timings, and then convolved using a standard HRF
  convolution.

<LI> EV3 is formed by multiplying EVs 1 and 2 together, and models the
  activation component of the control-tag signal. It is close to zero
  during rest and rises in amplitude during activation.

</UL>

<p> For an experiment with just a single experimental condition, these
  EVs are generally all that you need, and can be setup via
  the <b>Model setup wizard</b>. If you have more than one condition,
  then for each new condition you will need a new EV similar to EV2,
  modelling the BOLD response, and also a corresponding EV formed from
  interacting the BOLD response EV with EV1. Note that for each
  interaction EV, you need to click on the <b>Demean EV</b> button for
  EV1 only. This makes the modulation envelope for the perfusion
  activation EV symmetric about zero, rather than only positive, and
  results in a slightly better model of the perfusion data.

<p> The above assumes that the tag-control order of the data is such
  that the first timepoint is tag. If not, you should change
  the <b>Phase</b> for EV1 from 0 to the TR.

<p> You should leave FILM whitening turned on.

<hr><H3>Subtraction</H3>

<b>Perfusion subtraction</b> subtracts even from odd timepoints in
order to convert tag-control alternating timepoints into a
perfusion-only signal. If you are setting up a full perfusion model
(see above) then you should <i>not</i> use this option.

<p>To use the subtraction method, select your input data, and make
sure that you set the TR correctly (i.e., how long each tag or control
volume takes to acquire) in the <b>Data</b> part of the FEAT
GUI. Then, in <b>Pre-stats</b>, setup the pre-processing as normal in
FEAT, except that you should turn on <b>Perfusion subtraction</b>. You
should <i>not</i> be using <b>intensity normalisation</b> so leave
that turned off. You may wish to use <b>Highpass</b> filtering; this
will remove low frequency noise still present <i>after</i> the
subtraction processing. FEAT will automatically turn off FILM
prewhitening if you use perfusion subtraction (this is set in
the <b>Stats</b> part of the GUI).

<p>By default it is assumed that your first timepoint is tag, the
second is control, etc. If your data is the other way round, change
the <b>First timepoint is tag</b> setting to <b>First timepoint is
control</b>.

<p>Next, setup the model as you normally would for an FMRI analysis,
  with an EV for each experimental condition.  The subtraction causes
  a temporal shift of the sampled signal to half a TR earlier; hence
  you should ideally shift your model forwards in time by half a TR,
  for example by reducing custom timing onsets by half a TR or by
  increasing the model shape phase by half a TR.

<p>To see exactly what the subtraction processing is doing, look at
  the $FSLDIR/bin/perfusion_subtract script. This splits the original
  timeseries into two, one containing all even timepoints and the
  other containing all the odds. It then creates two new timeseries
  from each, in one case shifting the data forwards by half an
  (original) TR and in the other shifting it back by half a TR. The
  appropriate combinations of these are then subtracted from each
  other, before re-combining into a processed dataset that has the
  same number of timepoints as the original data. Sinc (temporal)
  interpolation is used in order to minimised temporal blurring
  induced by the shifting. This approach has better accuracy (with
  respect to removing BOLD contamination and recovering perfusion
  signal) and efficiency (particularly with respect to not halving the
  number of timepoints) than simpler perfusion subtraction
  methods. However, the filter affects the autocorrelation structure
  in the timeseries, in a way that is not well-matched to the
  autocorrelation estimation in FILM. This is why FILM whitening is
  turned off, and instead, to correct for the reduced degrees of
  freedom in the filtered data, the varcope and degrees-of-freedom are
  automatically corrected after running FILM in OLS mode.
