<H2>FEAT Programs</H2>

<UL>

<LI><b>Feat</b> - the FEAT GUI, as described above.

<br><br><LI><b>feat</b> - the FEAT script which the GUI calls when the
setup has been completed and <b>GO</b> is pressed. If you have saved a
FEAT setup file (eg design.fsf) to file, then you can run FEAT without
the GUI by typing <b>feat &lt;featsetupfile.fsf&gt;</b>.

<br><br><LI><b>Glm</b> - a GUI for setting up just the design matrix
and contrasts, in the same way as in FEAT, for use with other
modelling/inference programs such as randomise.

<br><br><LI><b>easythresh</b> - a simple script for carrying out cluster-based
thresholding and colour activation overlaying.

<br><br><LI><b>featregapply</b> - a program which applies the lowres
to standard-space registration transforms to the lowres stats images
in a FEAT directory to generate standard-space versions, for inputting
to higher-level analysis.

<br><br><LI><a href="featquery.html"
target="_top"><b>Featquery</b></a> (GUI) and <b>featquery</b>
(command-line script) - a program which allows you to interrogate FEAT
results by defining a mask or set of co-ordinates (in standard-space,
highres-space or loweres-space) and get mean stats values and
time-series.

<br><br><LI><b>feat_model</b> - a program which uses the FEAT setup
file to create the required design matrix as a text file, as well as
the related design matrix pictures.

<br><br><LI><b>mccutup</b> - convert the estimates of motion saved in
a FEAT directory to separate files which can then be fed into FEAT as
<b>Custom (1 entry per volume)</b> EVs.

<br><br><LI><b>Renderhighres</b> (GUI) and <b>renderhighres</b>
(command-line script) - transforms all thresholded stats images in a
FEAT directory into high resolution or standard space and overlays
these onto the high resolution or standard space images. This then
produces PNG format pictures of the overlays and, by default, deletes
the 3D AVW colour overlay images.

<br><br><LI><b>tsplot</b> - create time series plots for a FEAT directory.
