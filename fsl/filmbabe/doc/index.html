<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="hrfbasisfns.png"><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<p>FLOBS is a toolkit based around the idea of generating optimal
basis sets for use in HRF convolution in FMRI linear modelling such as
in FEAT. It allows the specification of sensible ranges for various
HRF-controlling parameters (delays and heights for the different parts
of the HRF "curve"), generates lots of example HRFs where each
timing/height parameter is randomly sampled from the range specified,
and then uses PCA to generate an optimal basis set that maximally
"spans the space" of the generated samples.

<P>It is easy to tell FEAT to use a FLOBS-generated basis set; either
use the <b>Make_flobs</b> GUI or use the default FLOBS basis set
supplied with FSL. Just select the <b>optimal/custom</b> HRF
convolution option in the FEAT model setup.

<p>It is also possible to use <b>filmbabe</b> instead of the normal
FEAT timeseries analysis (which uses the FILM program). The difference
is that filmbabe re-projects the optimal basis set onto the original
complete set of samples so that it can learn priors on the expected
means and covariances of the individual basis functions. This is so
that these priors can then be used when fitting the model to the data,
which means that the basis set is restricted from creating implausible
HRF shapes. This means that the noise is less "randomly fit" by the
model, giving better separation between the null part of the final
statistics map and the activation part, i.e. better activation
modelling power. Beware: note that the filmbabe program itself is a
relatively untested (beta release) program!

<HR><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gui_small.png"><H2>Make_flobs</H2>

<p>You can create your own optimal basis set using the
<b>Make_flobs</b> GUI; either type <b>Make_flobs</b> from the command
line, or find it under the <b>Utils</b> button in the FEAT GUI. The
GUI is fairly self-explanatory; using the figure that appears, showing
the HRF and its different controlling parameters (time widths set in
seconds and the height parameter relative to the main peak height,
which is set at 1), set the range you wish for each parameter. Press
<b>Preview</b> and the basis set will be generated (with a reduced
number of samples for speed), popping up a web browser window with the
results, typically in a minute or less. The eigenvalues plot shows the 
eigenvalues for the most important basis
functions which explain 99.5% of the variance.
This might help you to refine your choice of the number of basis
functions to use.

<p>Now select an output directory name for the basis function
information to get saved into (e.g. /Users/karl/my_basis_set.flobs)
and press <b>Go</b>. Now the full number of samples will be generated
and all necessary data (primarily the basis functions and their means
and covariances when re-projected back onto the samples) will get
saved for use in FEAT or in filmbabe.

<P>If you are using the basis set inside FEAT, just select the
<b>optimal/custom</b> HRF convolution option in the FEAT model setup
GUI (for <b>ALL</b> relevant EVs!) and use the adjacent file browser
button to change the default FLOBS directory to the one you have just
created (again, you must do this for <b>ALL</b> relevant EVs).

<HR><H2>filmbabe</H2>

<p>If you want to try the filmbabe program (don't forget it's a beta
release which hasn't been heavily tested yet!) then you should do the
following:<UL>

  <LI>Read the paper or techrep linked to above.

  <LI>Create your optimal basis set using <b>Make_flobs</b>.

  <LI>Run FEAT as normal, using this new basis set.

  <LI>Use <b>filmbabescript</b> as an easy way to run filmbabe, carry
  out inference (thresholding) and generate a web-page report. The
  usage is:
  <pre>filmbabescript &lt;feat_directory&gt; &lt;flobs_directory&gt;</pre>

</UL>

<p>Note that the stats output from filmbabe does <b>not</b> follow a
simple understood null-distribution (in the null case) so the standard
methods for thresholding (like those currently used in FEAT) are not
valid. Therefore filmbabescript makes use of the
<a href="../mm/index.html">mm</a> spatial mixture modelling program,
which explicitly models both the null and the activation parts of the
final stats image, allowing valid inference.
