<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<p>SUSAN noise reduction uses nonlinear filtering to reduce noise in
an image (2D or 3D) whilst preserving the underlying structure. It
does this by only averaging a voxel with local voxels which have
similar intensity. 

<P>For more detail on SUSAN and a journal reference, see the <A
HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/research/susan/">SUSAN
research web page</A>. If you use SUSAN in your research, please quote
the journal reference listed there.

<H3>Main Options</H3>

<p><b>Dimensionality</b>: by default a 3D image will be processed in
full 3D mode. If you want to process each slice separately, select 2D.

<p><b>Brightness threshold</b>: this allows SUSAN to discriminate
between noise and the underlying image. Ideally, the value should be
set greater than the noise level and less than the contrast of the
underlying image. Edges of contrast smaller than this threshold will
tend to be blurred by SUSAN whereas those of greater contrast will not
be.

<p><b>Mask SD</b>: this determines the spatial extent of the
smoothing. The mask is basically Gaussian with standard deviation (in
image units - e.g. mm) set by the user. However, for a small, fast,
flat response 3x3 or 3x3x3 voxel mask, set SD to 0.

<H3>Advanced Options</H3>

<p><b>Use median when no neighbourhood is found</b>: by default, when
the local neighbourhood of similar brightness voxels is empty, a local
median filter is used. This allows the correction of impulse
("salt-and-pepper") noise. This feature can be turned off if
desired. In this case, when no neighbourhood is found, the original
intensity of the voxel of interest remains unchanged.

<p><b>Separate images to find USAN from</b>: if the local area to be
smoothed over is to be found from an image (or images) other than the
main input image, this can be input here.
