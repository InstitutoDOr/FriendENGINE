Synopsis
--------

**dcm2niix** [*options*] <*sourcedir*>


Description
-----------

Most medical imaging devices save images in some variation of the popular DICOM
format. However, most scientific tools expect medical images to be stored in
the comparatively simpler NIfTI format. **dcm2niix** is designed to perform
such conversion from DICOM to NIfTI with a simple command-line interface.

Please be advised that **dcm2niix** has been developed for research purposes
only and should not be considered a clinical tool.


Options
-------

-b <y/n>        Save additional BIDS metadata to a side-car .json file.

-f <format>     Format string for the output filename(s). The following
                specifiers are supported:

                - %a, antenna (coil) number
                - %c, comments
                - %d, description
                - %e, echo number
                - %f, folder name
                - %i, patient ID
                - %m, manufacturer
                - %n, patient name
                - %p, protocol
                - %s, series number
                - %t, time
                - %u, acquisition number
                - %z, sequence name.

                The default format string is "%p_%e_%4s".

-m <y/n>        Merge slices from the same series regardless of study time,
                echo, coil, orientation, etc...

-o <path>       Output directory where the converted files should be saved. If
                unspecified, the files are saved within the specified source
                directory.

-s <y/n>        Convert a single file only.

-t <y/n>        Save patient details.

-v <h/y/n>  	Enable verbose output. "n" for succinct, "y" for verbose, "h" for
                high verbosity

-x <y/n>        Crop images.

-z <y/i/n>      Desired compression method. The "y"es option uses the external
                program pigz if available. The "i" option compresses the image
                using the slower built-in compression routines.
